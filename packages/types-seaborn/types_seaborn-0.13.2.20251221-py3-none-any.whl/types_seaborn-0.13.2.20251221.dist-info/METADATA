## Typing stubs for seaborn

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`seaborn`](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `seaborn`. This version of
`types-seaborn` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`seaborn==0.13.2`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/seaborn`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/seaborn)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.18.2
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.407

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`d8d989280c3f550a864815c4b6a28683d228531f`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/d8d989280c3f550a864815c4b6a28683d228531f).
