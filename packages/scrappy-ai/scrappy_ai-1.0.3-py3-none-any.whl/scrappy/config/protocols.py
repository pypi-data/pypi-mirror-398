"""
Configuration loading protocols.

Defines abstract interfaces for configuration loading from external sources.
These protocols enable dependency injection for testability and flexibility.

    """
    Abstract interface for loading configuration from external sources.

    This protocol enables:
    - Testing with mock loaders (no file I/O)
    - Different config sources (file, environment, remote)
    - Caching and validation strategies

    Implementations:
    - FileConfigLoader: Loads from YAML/JSON files
    - EnvironmentConfigLoader: Loads from environment variables
    - CompositeConfigLoader: Combines multiple sources

        Load and return configuration dictionary.

        Returns:
            Configuration data as a dictionary. Returns empty dict
            if no configuration is found (as opposed to raising).

        Raises:
            ConfigLoadError: If the config file exists but cannot be
                read or parsed (I/O error, syntax error, etc.)

class ConfigLoadError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when configuration cannot be loaded.

    This error is raised for:
    - File I/O errors (permission denied, etc.)
    - Parse errors (invalid YAML/JSON syntax)
    - Unsupported file formats

    This is NOT raised for:
    - Missing config file (returns empty dict instead)
