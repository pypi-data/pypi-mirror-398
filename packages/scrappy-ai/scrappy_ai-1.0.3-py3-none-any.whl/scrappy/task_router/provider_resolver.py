"""
Provider hint resolution utility.

Resolves ModelSelectionType to LiteLLM model groups.

After LiteLLM integration:
- Selection types map directly to model groups ("fast", "quality")
- No ProviderSelector needed - Router handles provider selection/fallback
- Model is always None - Router picks the actual model within the group

    Simplified: No longer needs ProviderSelector or orchestrator reference.
    Selection types map directly to model groups - the LiteLLM Router
    handles provider selection, fallback, and rate limiting internally.

    Model Groups:
    - "fast": 8B models, speed priority (Groq/Cerebras)
    - "quality": 70B+ models, 32k+ context (Gemini/Groq 70B)
