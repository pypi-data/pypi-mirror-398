"""
Configuration classes for the task router domain.

This module contains configuration dataclasses that belong to the task router
domain. Following dependency inversion, domain code should depend on
abstractions (protocols) defined locally, not on infrastructure (config loaders).

The config loading infrastructure (FileConfigLoader, etc.) depends on these
domain objects, not the other way around.

    This dataclass is immutable (frozen=True) to prevent accidental
    modification after loading from config file.

    Attributes:
        confidence_threshold: Confidence below this always needs clarification.
            Tasks with confidence below this value will always prompt
            for user clarification. Default: 0.7

        high_confidence_bypass: Confidence at or above this bypasses
            conflicting signal checks. When the classifier is highly
            confident, we trust it and skip additional checks.
