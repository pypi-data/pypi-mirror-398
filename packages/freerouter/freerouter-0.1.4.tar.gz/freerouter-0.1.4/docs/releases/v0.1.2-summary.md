# FreeRouter v0.1.2 Release Summary

**Release Date**: 2025-12-26  
**PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/freerouter/0.1.2/  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/mmdsnb/freerouter/releases/tag/v0.1.2

## Overview

Version 0.1.2 is a performance-focused release that introduces parallel provider fetching, delivering a **5x speedup** for the `freerouter fetch` command.

## Key Highlights

### 🚀 Performance Improvement
- **Parallel Provider Fetching**: 5x faster model discovery
- **Benchmark**: 2.5s → 0.5s with 5 providers
- **Implementation**: ThreadPoolExecutor-based concurrent execution
- **Error Handling**: Isolated failures don't block other providers

### 📊 Technical Details
- **Code Changes**: ~20 lines in `fetcher.py`
- **New Tests**: 2 additional tests for parallel execution
- **Test Coverage**: 83% (97 tests passing)
- **Dependencies**: No new dependencies added

### 📚 Documentation
- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` - Performance optimization guide
- `docs/features/parallel-fetching.md` - Feature documentation
- `tests/benchmark_parallel_fetch.py` - Performance benchmark script

## Installation

```bash
pip install freerouter==0.1.2
```

Or upgrade from previous version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade freerouter
```

## Usage

No configuration changes required. The parallel fetching is automatic:

```bash
freerouter fetch  # Now 5x faster!
```

## Benchmark Results

```
Setup:
  Providers: 5
  Delay per provider: 0.5s

Results:
  Sequential time: 2.50s
  Parallel time: 0.50s
  Speedup: 4.99x ✓
```

Run the benchmark yourself:

```bash
python tests/benchmark_parallel_fetch.py
```

## What's Included

All features from v0.1.1 plus parallel fetching:

- ✅ **NEW**: Parallel provider fetching (5x performance)
- ✅ Interactive model selector (`freerouter select`)
- ✅ Enhanced service management (`status`, `reload`, `restore`)
- ✅ Multi-provider support (OpenRouter, iFlow, Ollama, ModelScope, OAI, Static)
- ✅ Beautiful CLI with colors (rich library)
- ✅ Daemon-style service management
- ✅ 97 tests, 83% coverage

## Upgrade Guide

### From v0.1.1

Simply upgrade the package:

```bash
pip install --upgrade freerouter
```

No breaking changes. All existing configurations work as-is.

### From v0.1.0

Same as above. No configuration changes needed.

## Development Timeline

- **Feature Request**: Identified in ROADMAP.md as high-priority
- **Development**: 1 day (2025-12-26)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive tests added
- **Documentation**: Complete performance guide
- **Release**: Same day (2025-12-26)

## Impact

### User Benefits
1. **Faster Onboarding**: New users get started quicker
2. **Better UX**: Less waiting time for model discovery
3. **Scalability**: Performance doesn't degrade with more providers
4. **Reliability**: Isolated failures don't block entire fetch

### Technical Benefits
1. **Simple Implementation**: ~20 lines of code
2. **No New Dependencies**: Uses standard library
3. **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes
4. **Well Tested**: 97 tests passing

## Next Steps

According to the [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md), the next priorities are:

1. **Health Check** (`freerouter check`) - Validate provider connections
2. **Test Coverage** - Increase to 90%+
3. **Enhanced Init Wizard** - Interactive setup experience
