# FT8 Decoding and Encoding in Python with CLI and test/loopback code
This repository contains Python code to decode and encode FT8, plus a minimal command line interface for reception.

Its primary purpose is as a personal project, but should also be useful if you want to browse the code or use the CLI.

### CLI
PyFT8 can be installed using 

```
pip install PyFT8
```

and you can use 

```
PyFT8_cli "Keyword1, Keyword2" [-c]
```

to run the CLI where Keywords specify the input sound device (e.g. "Mic, CODEC") and -c means 'concise' output. Output will appear
in the command window when audio is received via the specified sound device.

You can also transmit FT8 using PyFT8 as follows. When launching the program, use

```
PyFT8_cli "Keyword1, Keyword2" [-c] -o "Keyword3, Keyword4"
```

where "Keyword3, Keyword4" specify the output sound device. Then, when you want to transmit a message, dump a file called
'PyFT8_tx_msg.txt' in the directory you launched from. The contents of this file should be for example:

```
CQ G1OJS IO90
```

with, optionally, a second line to specify the Tx audio frequency:

```
CQ G1OJS IO90
888
```

PyFT8 will wait for the *next* cycle boundary, and the file will be deleted during the transmit cycle. If you want to transmit via a transceiver,
you will have to organise your own method of controlling the PTT (e.g. [DATA]VOX, or sending your own CAT commands).

### Test scripts
Below are some screenshots from test programs that can be used to look at how the protocols actually work, illustrated with a fairly
ordinary waterfall and some zoomed-in depictions of captured signals with an overlay of the syncrhonisation tones that are used
to search for the signals (Costas patterns). To try these scripts, download the Python from this repository (clone, download raw etc)
and run in your chosen environment.

## Approach
You won't find many comments in the code; I try to make things as obvious as possible via variable names and logical structure, to 
minimise the *need for* comments. Also - this is mainly my plaything, and I find bloated, sprawling code incredibly difficult to 
read, so I like to keep things very compact so that I can see the bigger picture. If you find an if-then-else spanning several
paragraphs, it's probably a mistake.

Do feel free to get in touch and ask how anything works. I might add some diagrams etc at some point too - especially
if I find an approach that seems to offer something improved and/or very compact (I'm very pleased for e.g. that the entire candidate
search, synch, and demodulate process all works by refering to a single time-frequency grid; read the audio, FFT 5 times for each 
symbol duration, store it, and that's used for everything that follows.)

## Limitations
In pursuit of tight code, I've concentrated on core standard messages, leaving out some of the less-used features. The receive part of the
code doesn't (yet) have the full capability of the advanced decoders used in WSJT-x, and so gets only about 50% of the decodes that WSJT-x gets.
### Here's my current understanding of the differences:

|Step|PyFT8|WSJT-X|
|-----|------|-------|
|Find candidate signals|Search every possible time/frequency offset for match with the Costas pattern, excluding times where candidates would not complete before the next cycle (i.e. first few seconds of the grid)| TBD |
|Syncronise signals in time | See above | TBD|
|Use of FFTs for the above | A single time-frequency grid with 5 time samples per symbol and 3 frequency samples per tone| Several FFTs per operation, details in VK3JPK's great write-up [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/vk3jpk/ft8-notes/blob/master/Receive.ipynb)|
|Demodulation|Extract 1 sample per symbol, 1 sample per tone grid. Correlate each symbol with Gray code to create Log Likelyhood Ratios for each bit. | Noncoherent block detection over 3 symbols - creates LLRs by correlating the 512 possible tone sequences (3 symbols with 8 possible tones each) with the actual received symbols. This is done in the frequency domain by combining the whole-symbol correlations already calculated.  |
|Decoding the FEC code | Belief Propagation LDPC decoder | Belief Propagation LDPC decoder |
|Further decoding if LDPC fails| None | Ordered Statistics Decoding |
|Further signal extraction | None | Subtraction of the idealised power of the decoded signals, then rescanning the residual spectrum. Further synchronisation adjustments TBC|

## Performance
As of 28th Dec 2025, PyFT8 decodes around 50 to 100% of WSJTx decodes when the latter is set to "FAST" decoding, with an average around 65%.
