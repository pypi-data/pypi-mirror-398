        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

        source, and configuration files.
        
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.
        
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (which shall not include communications that are marked
        conspicuously as "Not a Contribution").
        
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based upon (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and derivative works thereof.
        
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
        systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf
        of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
        but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and prepare
        Derivative Works of, and to publicly perform and publicly display the
        Work and derivative works thereof.
        
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
        
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and
        
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, trademark, patent, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and
        
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.
        
        You may add Your own copyright notice to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Support. You may choose to offer, and to
        charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity, or other liability
        obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
        accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
        Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
        only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
        harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
        such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or support.

**MLflow Artifact Repository plugin** that stores artifacts as **Cloudsmith RAW packages**.

---

## Key Features

* Seamless MLflow integration (`cloudsmith://owner/repo`)
* List/Download artifacts within the MLflow UI
* Organized via tags (`mlflow`, `experiment-<id>`, `run-<id>`, `path-<artifact_path>`)

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install mlflow-cloudsmith
```

---

## Usage with MLflow

```python
import os
import mlflow

os.environ["CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY"] = "<your-api-key>"
os.environ["MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI"] = "cloudsmith://<owner>/<repo>"

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 0.01)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.95)
    mlflow.log_artifact("model.pkl")
```

### Direct Repository Usage

```python
from plugin.cloudsmith_repository import CloudsmithArtifactRepository

repo = CloudsmithArtifactRepository("cloudsmith://<owner>/<repo>")
repo.log_artifact("model.pkl", "models/production")

for info in repo.list_artifacts("models"):
    print(info.path, info.file_size, info.is_dir)
```
### Example startup:

```bash
mlflow server \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 5000 \
  --artifacts-destination cloudsmith://<CLOUDSMITH_NAMESPACE>/<CLOUDSMITH_REPO>
```


---

## URI Format

```
cloudsmith://<owner>/<repository>[/<path>]
```

**Examples:**

* `cloudsmith://my-org/ml-artifacts`
* `cloudsmith://my-org/ml-artifacts/experiments`

---

## Configuration

| Variable               | Description                                | Required |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY`   | Cloudsmith API token                       | ✅        |
| `CLOUDSMITH_DEBUG`     | `true` / `false` to toggle verbose logging | ❌        |
| `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID` | Used for tagging                           | ❌        |
| `MLFLOW_RUN_ID`        | Used for tagging                           | ❌        |

---

## How It Works (Brief)

* Each MLflow artifact is uploaded as a **Cloudsmith RAW package** with preserved original filename and metadata.
* The plugin builds an **in-memory tree** of artifact paths and returns **only immediate children** for UI browsing.
* Packages are tagged for easy filtering:
  `mlflow`, `experiment-*`, `run-*`, `path-*` (slashes replaced with dashes).

---

## Artifact Representation & Tagging

**Example Run Context**

* `experiment_id`: `123`
* `run_id`: `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef`
* Files logged:

  * `models/model.pkl`
  * `conda.yaml`

**Package Details**

* **Name:** `mlflow-<base-filename>-<run_id_first8>-<timestamp>`
  e.g., `mlflow-model-01234567-1754914964`
* **Version:** `<experiment_id>+<run_id>`
  e.g., `123+0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef`
* **Filename:** Original filename (e.g., `model.pkl`)
* **Description:**

  ```
  MLflow artifact: <artifact_path> (experiment: <experiment_id>, run: <run_id>)
  ```

  e.g., `MLflow artifact: models/model.pkl (experiment: 123, run: 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef)`
* **Tags:**

  * `mlflow`
  * `experiment-123`
  * `run-0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef`
  * `path-models-model.pkl`

**Notes**

* Descriptions hold the authoritative artifact path for listing & downloads.
* `path-*` tags replace `/` with `-` for fallback reconstruction.
* **MLflow UI listing:**

  * `list_artifacts("")` → `[models/ (dir), conda.yaml]`
  * `list_artifacts("models")` → `[models/model.pkl]`

---

## Testing

```bash
pytest -q
```

### Integration Tests (Opt-in)

```bash
export CLOUDSMITH_RUN_INTEGRATION=1
export CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY=""      # required
export CLOUDSMITH_TEST_OWNER=""   # required
export CLOUDSMITH_TEST_REPO=""    # required

pytest -q
```

---

## Cleanup Script (Delete by Run/Experiment)

`scripts/cleanup_orphans.sh` deletes Cloudsmith RAW packages for a given run or experiment ID.
**No MLflow server is contacted.** Requires: `bash`, `curl`, `jq`.

**Environment Variables / Flags**

| Variable / Flag                     | Description                        | Required |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| `CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY`                | API key                            | ✅        |
| `CLOUDSMITH_OWNER`                  | Owner/org slug                     | ✅        |
| `CLOUDSMITH_REPO`                   | Repo slug                          | ✅        |
| `RUN_ID` / `--run-id`               | MLflow run ID                      | ❌        |
| `EXPERIMENT_ID` / `--experiment-id` | MLflow experiment ID               | ❌        |
| `CLEANUP_CONFIRM=1` / `--confirm`   | Perform deletion (dry-run default) | ❌        |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Dry-run: show packages for a run-id
CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY="" CLOUDSMITH_OWNER=myorg CLOUDSMITH_REPO=myrepo \
    scripts/cleanup_orphans.sh --run-id 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

# Delete for a run-id (confirmation required)
CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY="" CLOUDSMITH_OWNER=myorg CLOUDSMITH_REPO=myrepo \
    scripts/cleanup_orphans.sh --run-id 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef --confirm

# Combine experiment-id + run-id
CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY="" CLOUDSMITH_OWNER=myorg CLOUDSMITH_REPO=myrepo \
    scripts/cleanup_orphans.sh --experiment-id 123 --run-id 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef --confirm
```
