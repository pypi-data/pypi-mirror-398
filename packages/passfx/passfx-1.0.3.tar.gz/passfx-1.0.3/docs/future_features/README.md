# Future Features

This directory contains architecture research and design documents for features that have been investigated but not yet implemented.

---

## Why These Exist

Some features require significant research before implementation. Rather than lose that work, we preserve it here for when the project scale or contributor interest justifies the engineering investment.

## For Contributors

These documents represent **optional challenges** for contributors who want to make a significant impact on PassFX. Each document includes:

- Problem statement and motivation
- Architecture options with tradeoffs
- Recommended approach
- Open questions to resolve
- Implementation checklist

If you're interested in tackling one of these features:

1. Open an issue to discuss your intent
2. Reference the existing research
3. Propose any updates to the design based on current project state
4. Coordinate with maintainers before starting implementation

## Current Documents

| Document | Description | Complexity |

_These are not roadmap commitments. Implementation depends on contributor interest and project needs._
