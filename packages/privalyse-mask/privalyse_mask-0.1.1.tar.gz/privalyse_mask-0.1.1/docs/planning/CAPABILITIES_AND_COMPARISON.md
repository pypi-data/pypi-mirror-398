# 🛡️ Capabilities & Competitive Analysis

## 🚀 Current Status: What Works Well?

Based on our latest benchmarks (Dec 2025), `privalyse-mask` excels in **Utility** and **Consistency**, making it ideal for LLM workflows where context matters.

### ✅ 1. Perfect Reversibility (100% Consistency)
- **Feature**: `unmask(mask(text)) == text`
- **Benchmark**: 100% success rate on synthetic datasets.
- **Why it matters**: You can safely send masked data to an LLM and restore the original PII in the response without data loss. Most simple redaction tools are one-way.

### ✅ 2. High Semantic Utility (100% Context Preservation)
- **Feature**: Replaces PII with *meaningful* surrogates (`{Location_Berlin}`) instead of generic tags (`<LOCATION>`).
- **Benchmark**: 100% of intent classification tasks succeeded on masked text.
- **Why it matters**: LLMs need context. Knowing a user is in "Berlin" (even if masked as `{Location_Berlin}`) allows the LLM to suggest German laws or timezones, whereas `<REDACTED>` leaves the LLM blind.

### ✅ 3. Custom Recognizers
- **Feature**: Built-in support for German IDs and Spaced IBANs (often missed by standard tools).
- **Status**: Fully functional and integrated into the default pipeline.

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
- **Recall on Synthetic Data (80%)**: On short, context-free sentences generated by `Faker`, the underlying NER model missed ~20% of entities. This is common for statistical models (Spacy) on synthetic data but needs tuning for production use.

## ⚔️ Comparison with Other Tools

| Feature | 🛡️ **Privalyse Mask** | 🏢 **Microsoft Presidio** (Raw) | ✂️ **Simple Redaction** | ☁️ **SaaS APIs** (PrivateAI, etc.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Philosophy** | **Privacy + Utility** (LLM-focused) | Detection & Anonymization | Removal | Privacy as a Service |
| **Reversibility** | ✅ **Native** (Auto-mapping) | ❌ Manual implementation required | ❌ Impossible | ✅ (Usually paid feature) |
| **Context Awareness** | ✅ **Semantic Surrogates** (`{Date_2023}`) | ⚠️ Basic (`<DATE>`) | ❌ None (`<REDACTED>`) | ✅ High |
| **Data Residency** | ✅ **Local / On-Prem** (Python Lib) | ✅ Local / On-Prem | ✅ Local | ❌ Data leaves your infra |
| **Cost** | 🆓 **Open Source** | 🆓 Open Source | 🆓 Free | 💰 Expensive / API calls |
| **Customization** | ✅ Easy (Python Classes) | ✅ Moderate | ❌ Hard | ❌ Limited |

### 🏆 Why Privalyse Mask?
1.  **Better than Raw Presidio**: We wrap Presidio to solve the "Reversibility" problem out-of-the-box. You don't need to write your own mapping logic.
2.  **Better than Redaction**: We keep the LLM smart. Redaction makes the LLM stupid.
3.  **Better than SaaS**: Your data never leaves your server. Zero trust required.

## 🎯 Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
> *"The only open-source tool designed specifically to keep LLMs smart while keeping data private, with zero-setup reversibility."*
