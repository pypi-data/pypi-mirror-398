class AdminRegions(OSMFeatures):
    """Base class for `administrative regions` at `various levels`.

    !!! warning "What to understand from this class?"
        In a nutshell? You barely will be using this out at all, unless you create a new
        `UrbanLayer` that needs to load `OpenStreetMap` features. If not, you can skip reading.

    This abstract class provides shared functionality for `loading` and `processing`
    `administrative boundaries` from `OpenStreetMap`. It's designed to be subclassed
    for specific types of administrative regions (`neighborhoods`, `cities`, `states`, `countries`).

    The class _intelligently_ handles the complexities of `OpenStreetMap's administrative
    levels`, which vary across different `countries` and `regions`. It attempts to infer
    the appropriate level based on the type of administrative division requested,
    but also allows manual overriding of this inference.

    Further can be read at: [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative)
    to understand why it is complex to infer the right `admin_level`.

    Attributes:
        division_type: The type of administrative division this layer represents
            (e.g., "neighborhood", "city", "state", "country").
        tags: OpenStreetMap tags used to filter boundary features.
        layer: The GeoDataFrame containing the administrative boundary data (set after loading).

    Examples:
        >>> # This is an abstract class - use concrete implementations like:
        >>> from urban_mapper import UrbanMapper
        >>> mapper = UrbanMapper()
        >>> # For neighborhoods:
        >>> neighborhoods = mapper.urban_layer.region_neighborhoods().from_place("Paris, France")
        >>> # For cities:
        >>> cities = mapper.urban_layer.region_cities().from_place("Hérault, France")
