# LocknKey CLI Scaffold

Typer-based CLI for LocknKey. This is a stub for login/init/run/service-token flows with client-side crypto helpers.

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install locknkeycmd
locknkeycmd --help
```

Commands are placeholders and log actions instead of talking to a real backend. Replace stubs with real Firebase/Firebase Auth integrations before production use.
