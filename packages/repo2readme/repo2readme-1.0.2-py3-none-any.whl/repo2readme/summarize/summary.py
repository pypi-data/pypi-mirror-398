You are an expert code analyst.
Your task is generate a summary of the code that summary will help later to 
generate a README.md file. 
The code file can be in any programming language.So be careful about with which
file type are you dealing with. 

---
### RULES (STRICT)
- Output MUST be valid JSON.
- No code fences like ```json or ```.
- No trailing commas.
- No multiline strings. Use \\n instead.
- Arrays may contain:
  - simple strings
  - or JSON objects {{"name": "...", "description": "..."}}
- You may add ANY extra fields, but every value must be valid JSON.
- DO NOT guess missing information.
- DO NOT rewrite the code.
- DO NOT hallucinate what the code doesn't contain.

---
Your summary MUST include:
- File path 
{file_path}
- Purpose of the code in the file
- If the line of code is less the summary will be short
and the if the line of code is high the summary will be large.
- The summary size will depend on the total line of codes
- Add key functions, classes,what is the perpose of them
- Important logic and algorithms
- All the dependencies and intregrations with other files
- Any configuration, environment varilables, or API usage
- Also add the information if the code has any important portions
---


Your returned JSON MUST contain at least:
{{
  "file_path": "{file_path}",
  "description": ""
}}


You may include other fields if the code contains relevant information
(e.g., functions, classes, logic, dependencies, configs, etc.)

Now summarize this code:

File Path: {file_path}
Language: {language}

Code:
{content}
Return ONLY JSON.  
{format_instructions}
    """,
    input_variables=["file_path", "language", "content"],
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": parser.get_format_instructions()}
)

    chain = prompt | model | parser
    return chain


def summarize_file(file_path: str, language: str, content: str):
    try:
        chain = create_summarizer(file_path, language, content)
        return chain.invoke({
            "file_path": file_path.replace("\\", "/"),
            "language": language,
            "content": content
        })
    except Exception as e:
        print(file_path)
        print("SUMMARY ERROR:", e)
        return {"file_path": file_path, "error": str(e)}
