           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

## Features
- Empirical library and fully predicted library search
- End-to-end transfer learning for custom RT, mobility, and MS2 models
- Label free quantification with multiple normalization methods ([directLFQ](https://github.com/MannLabs/directlfq), [QuantSelect](https://github.com/MannLabs/QuantSelect))
- DIA multiplexing

We support the following vendor and processing modes:

| Platform              | Empirical lib | Predicted lib |
| :---------------- | :------: | :----: |
| Thermo .raw |   ✅   | ✅ |
| Sciex .wiff |   ✅   | ✅ |
| Bruker .d |  ✅   | ⚠️ |
> ⚠️ **Predicted libraries with Bruker .d data**<br>Alltough search is possible, alphaDIA's feature-free search takes a long time with fully predicted libraries. We are still evaluating how to better support fully predicted libraries.



alphaDIA is part of the [alphapept ecosystem](https://alphapept.org):
- [alphaBase](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphabase)
- [alphaRaw](https://github.com/MannLabs/alpharaw)
- [alphaTims](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphatims)
- [alphaPept](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapept)
- [alphaPeptDeep](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapeptdeep)
- [directLFQ](https://github.com/MannLabs/directlfq)
- [alphaQuant](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphaquant)

## Installation

AlphaDIA can be installed on Windows, macOS and Linux. Please choose the preferred installation:

* [**One-click GUI installation:**](#one-click-gui-installation) Choose this installation if you only want the GUI and/or keep things as simple as possible.

* [**Pip installation**](#pip-installation)This version allows you to use alphaDIA in your python environment (provided e.g. by conda). You will only have access to the search engine backend and the command line but not the GUI.

* [**Developer installation:**](docs/installation.md#developer-installation) This installation allows to modify alphaDIA's source code directly. Generally, the developer version of alphaDIA outperforms the precompiled versions which makes this the installation of choice for high-throughput experiments.

* [**Docker installation:**](docs/installation.md#use-the-dockerized-version) Choose this for running alphaDIA in a Docker container, which is useful if you want to run it in a cloud environment.

* [**Slurm installation:**](docs/installation.md#slurm-cluster-installation) Choose this for running alphaDIA on a research cluster with Slurm.

### One-click GUI installation
You can download the latest release of alphaDIA [here](https://github.com/Mannlabs/alphadia/releases/latest).


#### Windows
Download the latest `alphadia-X.Y.Z-windows-amd64.exe` build and double click it to install. If you receive a warning during installation click *Run anyway*.
Important note: always install AlphaDIA into a new folder, as the installer will not properly overwrite existing installations.

#### Linux
If you want to search `.raw` files from Thermo instruments or `.wiff` files from Sciex instruments, [AlphaRaw](https://github.com/MannLabs/alpharaw) is required, which depends on Mono.
A detailed guide to installing AlphaRaw with mono can be found [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/alpharaw#installation).

Download the latest `alphadia-X.Y.Z-linux-x64.deb` build and install it via `dpkg -i alphadia-X.Y.Z-linux-x64.deb`.

Important note: the installer is built on Ubuntu 22.04, which limits its compatibility with other Linux distributions.
If you have troubles installing it, please fall back to the
[pip installation](docs/installation.md#pip-installation) with [manual](docs/installation.md#3-installation-gui-optional) GUI installation.

#### MacOS
If you want to search `.raw` files from Thermo instruments or `.wiff` files from Sciex instruments, [AlphaRaw](https://github.com/MannLabs/alpharaw) is required, which depends on Mono.
A detailed guide to installing AlphaRaw with mono can be found [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/alpharaw#installation).

Download the latest build suitable for your chip architecture
(can be looked up by clicking on the Apple Symbol > *About this Mac* > *Chip* ("M1", "M2", "M3" -> `arm64`, "Intel" -> `x64`),
`alphadia-X.Y.Z-macos-darwin-arm64.pkg` or `alphadia-X.Y.Z-macos-darwin-x64.pkg`. Open the parent folder of the downloaded file in Finder,
right-click and select *open*. If you receive a warning during installation click *Open*.

In newer MacOS versions, additional steps are required to enable installation of unverified software.
This is indicated by a dialog telling you `“alphadia. ... .pkg” Not Opened`.
1. Close this dialog by clicking `Done`.
2. Choose `Apple menu` > `System Settings`, then `Privacy & Security` in the sidebar. (You may need to scroll down.)
3. Go to `Security`, locate the line "alphadia.pkg was blocked to protect your Mac" then click `Open Anyway`.
4. In the dialog windows, click `Open Anyway`.


As of now, **Linux** users need follow the steps for the
[developer installation](docs/installation.md#developer-installation) in order to use the GUI.

### Pip installation
If you want to use alphaDIA as a python library (e.g. for importing it into Jupyter notebooks) or only use the command-line interface,
you can install alphaDIA via `pip`.

#### 1. Prerequisites
Please make sure you have a valid installation of conda or miniconda.
We recommend setting up miniconda as described on their [website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/).

If you want to use `.raw` files on Thermo instruments alphaRaw is required, which depends on Mono. A detailed guide to installing AlphaRaw with mono can be found [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/alpharaw#installation).

#### 2. Setting up the environment
For any Python package, it is highly recommended to use a separate, as otherwise dependency conflicts can occur with already existing packages. We generally recommend [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/), see [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphadia/blob/main/docs/installation.md#pip-installation) for more information on setting up the environment.

Finally, alphaDIA and all its dependencies can be installed by
```bash
pip install "alphadia[stable]"
```
We strongly recommend using the `stable` version, which has all dependencies fixed,
for reasons of reproducibility and integrity.

Alternatively, use
`pip install alphadia`, which comes with less version constraints. This is not recommended, but may be useful to avoid
version clashes if alphaDIA is imported as a library into a defined python requirement.
Note however, that this "loose" version might be affected e.g. by breaking changes of third-party dependencies.

Finally, run `alphadia --check` to check if the installation was successful;
`alphadia -h` will give you a list of command-line options.

## Getting started

This guide will show you how to perform your first search using the One-click GUI.
### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed the GUI using the one-click installer. To verify your installation, open alphaDIA and make sure that the `BundledExecutionEngine` is selected.

<img src="assets/select_engine.gif" alt="Logo" width="400" height="auto">

### 2. Test data

For the first search we will be using a spectral library to search 60SPD bulk HeLa samples on the Orbitrap Astral.
Download the test samples and save them:
[HeLa library](https://datashare.biochem.mpg.de/s/Uw2yfNSbApfPpTk),
[RAW files](https://datashare.biochem.mpg.de/s/339jg5HtGrwLwDN)

### 3. Search settings

#### Input Files
Import the library `.hdf` file and select the thre `.raw` files. You can select a human `.fasta` file for reannotation but it's generally not recommended for empirical spectral libraries.

#### Method Settings
Although alphaDIA is highly customizable, we will only specify a limited number of settings here. Go to the *Search* settings and make the following changes:
* Number of candidates: 5
* MS1 Tolerance 4ppm
* MS2 Tolerance 7ppm

#### Output files
Select an output folder where the search progress and the final results should be saved.

### 4. Run the search
Click *Run Workflow* to start the search and see the progress.

## Troubleshooting

In case of issues, check out the following:

* [Issues](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphadia/issues): Try a few different search terms to find out if a similar problem has been encountered before
* [Discussions](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphadia/discussions): Check if your problem or feature requests has been discussed before.

### Problem: Error when downloading the peptdeep pretrained models
If on startup you receive an error like
`FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '<some_directory>/peptdeep/pretrained_models'`,
it could be due to missing write permissions on `<some_directory>`.

#### Solution
For now, you need to create this directory yourself and manually download the file
```
mkdir -p <some_directory>/peptdeep/pretrained_models && cd <some_directory>/peptdeep/pretrained_models
wget https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapeptdeep/releases/download/pre-trained-models/pretrained_models.zip
```
