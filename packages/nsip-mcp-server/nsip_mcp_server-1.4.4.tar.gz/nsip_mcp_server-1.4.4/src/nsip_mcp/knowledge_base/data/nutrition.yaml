#
# Comprehensive nutrition guidance by life stage with regional considerations.
# Energy values in TDN (Total Digestible Nutrients) percentage.
# Protein values in Crude Protein (CP) percentage.

life_stages:
  maintenance:
    description: "Non-pregnant, non-lactating adult sheep"
    timing: "Year-round for dry ewes, rams out of breeding"
    protein: "8-10%"
    energy: "TDN 50-55%"
    dry_matter_intake: "2.0-2.5% body weight"
    notes: >
      Goal is to maintain body condition. Adjust based on BCS -
      increase if below 2.5, decrease if above 4.0.

  flushing:
    description: "Pre-breeding nutrition boost to increase ovulation"
    timing: "2-3 weeks before ram turnout through breeding"
    protein: "12-14%"
    energy: "TDN 60-65%"
    energy_increase: "15-20% above maintenance"
    notes: >
      Most effective for ewes in moderate condition (BCS 2.5-3.0).
      Thin ewes need longer recovery; fat ewes may not respond.
      Rising plane of nutrition is key, not absolute level.

  early_gestation:
    description: "First 100 days of pregnancy"
    timing: "Day 1-100 of pregnancy"
    protein: "10-12%"
    energy: "TDN 55-60%"
    notes: >
      Fetal growth minimal during this period. Maintain BCS at 3.0.
      Good time to recover condition on thin ewes. Avoid toxins
      and stress that could cause embryonic loss.

  late_gestation:
    description: "Final 6 weeks of pregnancy"
    timing: "Day 100-150 (or to lambing)"
    protein: "14-16%"
    energy: "TDN 65-70%"
    energy_increase: "50-70% above maintenance"
    critical_nutrients:
      - calcium: "Gradually increase to 0.4-0.6% of diet"
      - selenium: "0.3 ppm (supplement if deficient area)"
      - vitamin_e: "15-30 IU/lb dry matter"
      - iodine: "0.1-0.8 ppm"
    notes: >
      70% of fetal growth occurs in last 6 weeks. Ewes with twins/triplets
      need higher plane. Monitor for pregnancy toxemia in thin ewes or
      those with multiples. Ensure adequate bunk space - 18-24" per ewe.

  lactation_early:
    description: "Peak lactation (first 6-8 weeks)"
    timing: "Lambing through 6-8 weeks"
    protein: "16-18%"
    energy: "TDN 70-75%"
    energy_increase: "100-120% above maintenance for twins"
    notes: >
      Highest nutrient demand of entire production cycle. Ewes will
      mobilize body reserves if underfed. Singles need less than twins.
      Milk production peaks 3-4 weeks post-lambing.

  lactation_late:
    description: "Declining lactation to weaning"
    timing: "6-8 weeks to weaning (60-90 days)"
    protein: "14-16%"
    energy: "TDN 65-70%"
    notes: >
      Gradually reduce nutrition as lamb consumption increases.
      Goal is for ewes to regain condition before breeding while
      still supporting lamb growth.

  growing_lambs:
    description: "Post-weaning to market/selection"
    timing: "60 days to 5-7 months"
    protein: "16-18% early, 14-16% later"
    energy: "TDN 70-75%"
    notes: >
      Balance growth rate with management goals. Terminal lambs can
      push for maximum gain. Replacement ewe lambs benefit from
      moderate growth to ensure skeletal development.

  finishing_lambs:
    description: "Final feeding period before market"
    timing: "Last 4-8 weeks before slaughter"
    protein: "14-16%"
    energy: "TDN 75-80%"
    notes: >
      High energy to maximize rate of gain and finish. Watch for
      enterotoxemia - vaccinate and adapt gradually. Adequate
      fiber (10%+ roughage) prevents acidosis.

  breeding_rams:
    description: "Rams during and after breeding season"
    timing: "30 days before through breeding (60-90 days)"
    protein: "14-16%"
    energy: "TDN 65-70%"
    notes: >
      Rams lose 10-15% body weight during breeding. Start in good
      condition (BCS 3.5-4.0). Supplement during breeding if
      running with large groups.

mineral_requirements:
  macro_minerals:
    calcium:
      maintenance: "0.2-0.3%"
      late_gestation: "0.4-0.6%"
      lactation: "0.5-0.8%"
      notes: "Ca:P ratio should be 2:1"

    phosphorus:
      all_stages: "0.2-0.3%"
      notes: "Important for growth and reproduction"

    magnesium:
      all_stages: "0.12-0.18%"
      notes: "Higher for lactating ewes on lush pasture (grass tetany risk)"

    salt:
      all_stages: "0.4-0.5%"
      notes: "Free choice salt recommended"

  trace_minerals:
    selenium:
      requirement: "0.1-0.3 ppm"
      deficiency_areas: ["Pacific Northwest", "Great Lakes", "Northeast"]
      notes: "Supplement in deficient areas; toxicity above 5 ppm"

    copper:
      requirement: "7-11 ppm"
      notes: "Sheep very sensitive to copper toxicity. Never use cattle minerals."

    zinc:
      requirement: "20-33 ppm"
      notes: "Important for immune function and hoof health"

    iodine:
      requirement: "0.1-0.8 ppm"
      notes: "Goiter in deficient lambs; most areas adequate"

regional_considerations:
  northeast:
    selenium_deficiency: true
    grass_tetany_risk: "moderate"
    summer_heat_stress: "occasional"
    notes: >
      Selenium supplementation often needed. Watch for grass tetany
      on lush spring pasture. Most forages adequate quality.

  southeast:
    selenium_deficiency: false
    grass_tetany_risk: "low"
    summer_heat_stress: "significant"
    endophyte_fescue: true
    notes: >
      Avoid endophyte-infected tall fescue during breeding and late
      gestation - causes reduced conception, agalactia, prolonged
      gestation. Heat stress reduces intake; provide shade, feed
      during cool hours, ensure adequate water.

  midwest:
    selenium_deficiency: "variable"
    grass_tetany_risk: "moderate"
    summer_heat_stress: "moderate"
    notes: >
      Corn belt provides excellent feed options. Test soils and
      forages for mineral content. Adequate quality forages available.

  southwest:
    selenium_deficiency: false
    grass_tetany_risk: "low"
    summer_heat_stress: "severe"
    water_quality: "variable"
    notes: >
      Water access critical. May need to adjust feeding times.
      Some areas have high TDS water affecting intake. Browse
      and range plants often high in protein.

  mountain:
    selenium_deficiency: "variable"
    grass_tetany_risk: "moderate"
    altitude_effects: true
    notes: >
      High altitude reduces intake capacity. Range forage quality
      varies seasonally. Supplementation critical during drought
      or winter. Watch for poisonous plants.

  pacific:
    selenium_deficiency: true
    grass_tetany_risk: "high"
    notes: >
      Selenium supplementation essential (Pacific Northwest especially).
      Lush cool-season pastures increase grass tetany risk.
      Vitamin E often needed with selenium.

seasonal_adjustments:
  summer:
    heat_stress: |
      - Provide shade and adequate water
      - Feed during cool morning/evening hours
      - Reduce handling during hot periods
      - Consider electrolyte supplementation

  winter:
    cold_stress: |
      - Increase energy 10-20% in severe cold
      - Ensure adequate dry matter intake
      - Protect from wind and wet conditions
      - Unfrozen water critical

  spring:
    transition: |
      - Gradual transition to lush pasture (7-10 days)
      - Watch for grass tetany on cool-season grasses
      - Monitor for bloat on legume pastures
      - Parasite season begins

  fall:
    preparation: |
      - Assess body condition before breeding
      - Flush ewes if needed
      - Stock up on winter feed
      - Prepare for late gestation needs
