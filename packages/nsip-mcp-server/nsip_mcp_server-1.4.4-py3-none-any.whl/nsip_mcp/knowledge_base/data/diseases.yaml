common_diseases:
  footrot:
    description: >
      Bacterial infection (Dichelobacter nodosus + Fusobacterium necrophorum)
      causing lameness and hoof damage. Highly contagious in wet conditions.
    prevention:
      - Maintain dry conditions in high-traffic areas
      - Regular hoof trimming and inspection
      - Footbath with 10% zinc sulfate solution
      - Quarantine new arrivals for 30 days
      - Cull chronic carriers
      - Select for foot health (genetic component)
    treatment: >
      Isolate affected animals immediately. Trim all necrotic tissue,
      topical treatment with zinc sulfate or copper sulfate, systemic
      antibiotics (LA-200) for severe cases. Dry environment critical.
    regional_risk:
      northeast: high
      southeast: very_high
      midwest: moderate
      southwest: low
      mountain: low
      pacific: moderate

  internal_parasites:
    description: >
      Haemonchus contortus (barber pole worm) is the primary threat,
      along with Teladorsagia, Trichostrongylus species. Causes anemia,
      bottle jaw, weight loss, death in severe cases.
    prevention:
      - FAMACHA scoring every 2-3 weeks during season
      - Selective deworming (treat only animals that need it)
      - Pasture rotation with 60+ day rest periods
      - Multi-species grazing when possible
      - Select for parasite resistance (FEC EBV)
      - Avoid grazing wet, shaded areas
      - Use refugia strategy to maintain susceptible worm population
    treatment: >
      Deworm based on FAMACHA score (3+) or fecal egg count. Rotate
      drug classes to prevent resistance. Check efficacy with fecal
      egg count reduction test. Supportive care for anemic animals.
    regional_risk:
      northeast: high
      southeast: very_high
      midwest: moderate
      southwest: moderate
      mountain: low
      pacific: moderate

  ovine_progressive_pneumonia:
    description: >
      OPP (Maedi-Visna) is a slow viral disease causing progressive lung
      damage, mastitis, arthritis. No treatment or vaccine available.
      Spread through respiratory secretions and infected colostrum/milk.
    prevention:
      - Test and cull positive animals
      - Raise lambs on pasteurized colostrum
      - Maintain closed flock when possible
      - Test all new purchases before introduction
      - Avoid nose-to-nose contact with unknown animals
    treatment: >
      No treatment available. Positive animals should be culled to
      prevent spread. Some flocks manage by separating positive
      animals and bottle-raising offspring.
    regional_risk:
      northeast: moderate
      southeast: moderate
      midwest: moderate
      southwest: moderate
      mountain: moderate
      pacific: moderate

  caseous_lymphadenitis:
    description: >
      CL (Cheesy Gland) is a chronic bacterial infection (Corynebacterium
      pseudotuberculosis) causing abscesses in lymph nodes. Highly
      contagious, difficult to eradicate once established.
    prevention:
      - Test and cull positive animals
      - Isolate animals with external abscesses
      - Disinfect shearing equipment between animals
      - Avoid sharing equipment with other flocks
      - Vaccinate in endemic flocks (Case-Bac or similar)
      - Quarantine all new purchases
    treatment: >
      External abscesses can be lanced, drained, and flushed with
      iodine - but this spreads bacteria. Best to isolate and
      cull affected animals. Internal abscesses untreatable.
    regional_risk:
      northeast: moderate
      southeast: high
      midwest: moderate
      southwest: high
      mountain: moderate
      pacific: high

  enterotoxemia:
    description: >
      Overeating disease caused by Clostridium perfringens types C and D.
      Affects rapidly growing lambs on high-concentrate diets.
      Often fatal before treatment can begin.
    prevention:
      - Vaccinate ewes 4-6 weeks before lambing (CDT vaccine)
      - Vaccinate lambs at 6-8 weeks, booster at 10-12 weeks
      - Gradual diet changes when increasing grain
      - Adequate fiber in diet (minimum 10% roughage)
      - Consistent feeding schedule
    treatment: >
      Often too late by the time signs appear. Antitoxin if
      available. Supportive care with oral electrolytes.
      Prevention far more effective than treatment.
    regional_risk:
      northeast: moderate
      southeast: moderate
      midwest: high
      southwest: moderate
      mountain: moderate
      pacific: moderate

  scrapie:
    description: >
      Fatal, degenerative neurological disease (transmissible spongiform
      encephalopathy). Required to enroll in USDA Scrapie Eradication
      Program. Genetic testing available.
    prevention:
      - Enroll in USDA Scrapie Flock Certification Program
      - Genotype breeding stock (select for RR at codon 171)
      - Cull QQ and QR animals for breeding
      - Maintain proper animal identification
      - Practice good biosecurity
    treatment: >
      No treatment. Affected animals must be reported and euthanized.
      Federal indemnity program available for positive flocks.
    regional_risk:
      northeast: low
      southeast: low
      midwest: low
      southwest: low
      mountain: low
      pacific: low

  pregnancy_toxemia:
    description: >
      Ketosis in late-pregnancy ewes carrying multiples. Caused by
      negative energy balance when fetal nutrient demands exceed intake.
    prevention:
      - Body condition score of 3.0-3.5 at breeding
      - Increase energy in last 6 weeks of pregnancy
      - Ultrasound to identify ewes with multiples
      - Feed multiples separately with higher plane
      - Avoid stress and ensure adequate bunk space
    treatment: >
      Oral propylene glycol (60ml 2x daily), IV dextrose for
      severe cases. Induce lambing or C-section if close to term.
      Prognosis poor for recumbent ewes.
    regional_risk:
      northeast: moderate
      southeast: moderate
      midwest: moderate
      southwest: moderate
      mountain: moderate
      pacific: moderate

  mastitis:
    description: >
      Udder infection causing reduced milk production, lamb starvation,
      and potential ewe mortality. Can be acute (hot, swollen) or
      chronic (lumpy, reduced function).
    prevention:
      - Maintain clean lambing environment
      - Ensure adequate colostrum intake by lambs
      - Check udders at weaning
      - Cull ewes with chronic mastitis or hard bags
      - Trim teats if too large for lambs
    treatment: >
      Systemic antibiotics (consult vet for appropriate choice).
      Strip affected half frequently. Supportive care.
      Often results in loss of affected half for future lactations.
    regional_risk:
      northeast: moderate

    Risk levels are generalizations based on typical climate and
    management. Individual farm conditions may vary significantly.
    Local extension and veterinary guidance is essential.
