# Selection Index Definitions for Sheep Breeding
#
# Selection indexes combine multiple EBV traits into a single value for
# ranking animals. Weights reflect the relative economic or breeding
# importance of each trait for a specific production goal.
#
# Positive weights favor higher EBVs; negative weights favor lower EBVs.
# Traits not listed have zero weight in the index.

  terminal:
    name: "Terminal Sire Index"
    description: >
      Maximizes growth and carcass traits for market lamb production.
      Optimizes rams used on commercial ewes where all offspring go to market.
    weights:
      BWT: -0.5    # Reduce dystocia risk (lower better)
      WWT: 1.0     # Weaning growth
      PWWT: 1.5    # Post-weaning growth (primary emphasis)
      YWT: 1.0     # Yearling growth
      YEMD: 0.8    # Loin eye muscle depth
      YFAT: -0.3   # Reduce excess fat (lower better)
    use_case: >
      Use for terminal sire breeds (Suffolk, Hampshire, Texel) or any rams
      being used in a terminal cross where replacement ewes come from
      elsewhere. Emphasizes rapid growth and lean carcass.

selection_intensity_reference:
  description: >
    Selection intensity (i) relates to the proportion of animals retained.
    Higher intensity means fewer animals retained and faster genetic progress,
    but reduces selection options and may increase inbreeding.
  values:
    "50%": 0.80
    "40%": 0.97
    "30%": 1.16
    "20%": 1.40
    "10%": 1.76
    "5%": 2.06
    "1%": 2.67
  notes: >
    Typical commercial ram selection: top 5-10% (i = 1.76-2.06)
    Ewe lamb retention: top 50-70% (i = 0.50-0.80)
    Ram lamb retention for testing: top 20-30% (i = 1.16-1.40)

custom_index_guidance:
  description: >
    Users can create custom indexes by specifying weights for any
    combination of traits. Consider these principles:
  principles:
    - "Assign weights based on relative economic value of traits"
    - "Negative weights for traits where lower is better (BWT, YFAT, FEC)"
    - "Consider genetic correlations - some traits move together"
    - "More traits = less progress per trait (dilution effect)"
    - "Verify with economic analysis for your specific operation"
  warnings:
    - "Don't ignore birth weight when selecting for growth (dystocia risk)"
    - "Maternal traits have low heritability - slow progress expected"
    - "Very high selection intensity increases inbreeding"
