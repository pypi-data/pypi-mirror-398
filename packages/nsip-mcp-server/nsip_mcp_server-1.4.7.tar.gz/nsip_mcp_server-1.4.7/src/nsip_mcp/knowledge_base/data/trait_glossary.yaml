  # Growth Traits
  # ==========================================================================
  BWT:
    name: "Birth Weight"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for lamb birth weight. Higher values indicate
      heavier lambs at birth. Moderate values preferred - too high
      increases dystocia risk, too low may reduce survival.
    unit: "lbs"
    interpretation: "context_dependent"
    category: "growth"
    notes: >
      Target depends on breed and management. Terminal sires mated to
      mature ewes can tolerate higher BWT. First-time ewe lambs need
      rams with lower BWT.

  WWT:
    name: "Weaning Weight"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for weight at weaning (60-day adjusted).
      Higher values indicate faster pre-weaning growth.
    unit: "lbs"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "growth"
    notes: >
      Heavily influenced by maternal effects (milk, mothering).
      Direct WWT measures lamb's own growth genes; MWWT measures
      dam's contribution.

  PWWT:
    name: "Post-Weaning Weight"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for weight at 120 days. Measures growth
      after weaning when lamb is on its own without maternal support.
    unit: "lbs"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "growth"
    notes: >
      More heritable than WWT since maternal effects removed.
      Key trait for terminal sire selection.

  YWT:
    name: "Yearling Weight"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for weight at one year of age. Important
      for mature size and overall growth trajectory.
    unit: "lbs"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "growth"
    notes: >
      Correlated with mature size. Very high YWT may indicate
      larger mature ewes requiring more feed for maintenance.

  # ==========================================================================
  # Carcass/Ultrasound Traits
  # ==========================================================================
  YEMD:
    name: "Yearling Eye Muscle Depth"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for loin eye (longissimus) muscle depth
      measured by ultrasound at yearling age.
    unit: "mm"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "carcass"
    notes: >
      Indicator of muscling and meat yield. Correlated with
      carcass merit. Important for terminal sires.

  YFAT:
    name: "Yearling Fat Depth"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for subcutaneous fat depth measured by
      ultrasound at yearling age.
    unit: "mm"
    interpretation: "lower_better"
    category: "carcass"
    notes: >
      Excess fat is wasteful. However, some fat cover needed
      for carcass quality and ewe body reserves.

  PFAT:
    name: "Post-Weaning Fat Depth"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for fat depth at 120 days (post-weaning).
    unit: "mm"
    interpretation: "lower_better"
    category: "carcass"
    notes: >
      Earlier measurement than YFAT. Indicates tendency for
      early fat deposition.

  # ==========================================================================
  # Maternal Traits
  # ==========================================================================
  NLB:
    name: "Number of Lambs Born"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for litter size at birth. Higher values
      indicate more prolific ewes.
    unit: "lambs"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "maternal"
    notes: >
      Low heritability (h²=0.10). Slow to improve but economically
      important. Very high values may reduce lamb survival.

  NLW:
    name: "Number of Lambs Weaned"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for number of lambs weaned per ewe lambing.
      Combines prolificacy with lamb survival and mothering ability.
    unit: "lambs"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "maternal"
    notes: >
      Most important maternal trait economically. Reflects both
      reproduction and maternal ability. Low heritability.

  MWWT:
    name: "Maternal Weaning Weight"
    description: >
      Genetic effect of the dam on lamb weaning weight through
      milk production and mothering ability.
    unit: "lbs"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "maternal"
    notes: >
      Measures dam's contribution independent of lamb's own
      growth genes. Important for replacement ewe selection.

  # ==========================================================================
  # Health/Parasite Traits
  # ==========================================================================
  FEC:
    name: "Fecal Egg Count"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for internal parasite resistance as measured
      by fecal egg counts. Lower values indicate more resistant animals.
    unit: "eggs per gram (transformed)"
    interpretation: "lower_better"
    category: "health"
    notes: >
      Moderately heritable (h²=0.25). Important in regions with
      high Haemonchus pressure. Reduces deworming costs.

  DAG:
    name: "Dag Score"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for fecal soiling around the breech.
      Lower scores indicate cleaner animals less prone to flystrike.
    unit: "score (1-5)"
    interpretation: "lower_better"
    category: "health"
    notes: >
      Related to parasite burden and wool type. Important for
      animal welfare and reducing flystrike risk.

  # ==========================================================================
  # Wool Traits
  # ==========================================================================
  GFW:
    name: "Greasy Fleece Weight"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for total fleece weight before washing.
    unit: "lbs"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "wool"
    notes: >
      Important for wool income. Must balance with other traits.
      High GFW may indicate heavy grease content.

  CFW:
    name: "Clean Fleece Weight"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for fleece weight after scouring (washing).
      More accurate measure of saleable wool.
    unit: "lbs"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "wool"
    notes: >
      Better indicator of wool value than GFW. Yield is CFW/GFW.

  FD:
    name: "Fiber Diameter"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for wool fiber diameter (fineness).
      Finer wool commands premium prices.
    unit: "microns"
    interpretation: "lower_better"
    category: "wool"
    notes: >
      Highly heritable (h²=0.50). Major determinant of wool price.
      Must balance with fleece weight - very fine wool often lighter.

  SL:
    name: "Staple Length"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for annual wool growth length.
    unit: "mm"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "wool"
    notes: >
      Longer staples preferred for worsted processing. Must meet
      minimum for processing requirements.

  SS:
    name: "Staple Strength"
    description: >
      Genetic potential for resistance to fiber breakage.
      Stronger fibers maintain value through processing.
    unit: "N/ktex"
    interpretation: "higher_better"
    category: "wool"
    notes: >
      Affected by nutrition during growth. Weak point (tender wool)
      reduces value significantly.
