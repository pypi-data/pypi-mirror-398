# Trait Heritability Estimates for Sheep
#
# Heritability (h²) represents the proportion of phenotypic variance
# attributable to additive genetic effects. Values range from 0-1.
# Higher values indicate traits that respond well to selection.

# Notes on using heritability estimates:
notes:
  selection_response: |
    Expected genetic gain per generation = h² × selection intensity × phenotypic SD
    Example: WWT with h²=0.25, intensity=1.4, SD=5 lbs → gain = 0.25 × 1.4 × 5 = 1.75 lbs/generation

  accuracy_relationship: |
    Accuracy of EBV increases with more data (own records, progeny, relatives).
    Heritability affects how quickly accuracy builds - high h² traits reach
    high accuracy faster with own performance data.

  environmental_factors: |
    Heritability estimates assume adequate nutrition and management.
    Stressful environments may reduce expressed heritability.
    Within-flock h² may differ from published estimates.
