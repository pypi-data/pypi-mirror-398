      Varies dramatically by region and year. Grass hay typically less
      than alfalfa. Quality affects actual feeding value.

      Many commercial flocks find wool barely covers shearing cost.

profitability_analysis:
  breakeven_formula:
    description: "Calculate breakeven lamb price"
    formula: "(Total Annual Costs) / (Lambs Marketed per Ewe)"
    example:
      annual_costs: 250
      lambing_rate: 1.5
      lamb_death_loss: "10%"
      lambs_marketed: 1.35
      breakeven: 185  # $250 / 1.35 = $185 per lamb

    factors:
      - "EBV advantage over average"
      - "Number of offspring"
      - "Heritability of traits"
      - "Economic value per unit improvement"

    example:
      scenario: "Ram with +10 lb PWWT EBV vs average"
      ewes_bred: 35
      lamb_crop: 50  # 1.4 lambing rate
      genetic_advantage: 5  # Half goes to offspring (lbs)
      lamb_price: 2.25  # $/lb
      extra_revenue_per_year: 562  # 50 × 5 × 2.25
      ram_cost_premium: 800
      payback_years: 1.4
      notes: >
        Simplified example. Actual advantage depends on accuracy of
        EBV, management, and market conditions.
