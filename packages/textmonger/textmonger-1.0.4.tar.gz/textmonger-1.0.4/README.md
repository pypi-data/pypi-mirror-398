# The Text Monger

A package that combines: 
- **Readability Scoring**
- **Power Words Distribution**
- **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Named Entity Recognition**

mostly through predefined packages and a csv file (for power words).

## Installation
You can install The Text Monger package using `pip`:
```bash
pip install textmonger
```

## Usage
To pseudo-analyze a piece of text, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
textmonger
```
You will be prompted to enter the text. Type or paste your text, and when you're done, type `END` on a new line to finish input. The tool will then do the work that it's made to do!
