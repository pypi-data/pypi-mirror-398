"""
Network Flow, for assignment, matching, and bottleneck analysis.

Use max_flow when you need "how much can I push through this network?" -
assigning workers to tasks, servers to requests, finding bottlenecks.
Use min_cost_flow when cost matters: "what's the cheapest way to route X units?"
Think of: transportation, logistics and resource allocation with prices.

The max-flow min-cut theorem makes this useful for systems thinking: the maximum
flow equals the minimum cut, so you find bottlenecks for free.

    from solvor.flow import max_flow, min_cost_flow

    # graph: {node: [(neighbor, capacity, cost), ...]}
    result = max_flow(graph, source='s', sink='t')
    result = min_cost_flow(graph, source='s', sink='t', demand=10)

Works well with NetworkX for graph construction and visualization:

    import networkx as nx
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    G.add_edge('s', 'a', capacity=10, cost=1)
    G.add_edge('a', 't', capacity=5, cost=2)
    graph = {u: [(v, d['capacity'], d.get('cost', 0))
                 for v, d in G[u].items()] for u in G}
    result = max_flow(graph, 's', 't')

For heavier graph work (shortest paths, centrality, community detection),
NetworkX is very extensive. This solver focuses on the flow problems.
