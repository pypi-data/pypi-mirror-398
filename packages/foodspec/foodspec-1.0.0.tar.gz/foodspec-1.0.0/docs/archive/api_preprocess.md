# API reference: preprocessing (legacy)

> **Status: Legacy / Archived**  
> Superseded by [API index](../api/index.md) and [api/preprocessing.md](../api/preprocessing.md). Kept for reference only.

Preprocessing modules provide sklearn-compatible transformers for baseline correction, smoothing, normalization, cropping, FTIR/Raman helpers, and derivatives. For recommended pipelines, see the Preprocessing guide and workflow tutorials.

## Baseline

## Smoothing
::: foodspec.preprocess.smoothing

## Normalization & scatter correction
::: foodspec.preprocess.normalization

## Cropping
::: foodspec.preprocess.cropping

## FTIR / Raman helpers
::: foodspec.preprocess.ftir
::: foodspec.preprocess.raman

## Derivatives
::: foodspec.preprocess.derivatives
