# API reference: IO & datasets (legacy)

> **Status: Legacy / Archived**  
> Superseded by [API index](../api/index.md) and [api/io.md](../api/io.md). Kept for reference only.

IO and data modules handle conversion between raw files, CSV, HDF5 libraries, and example/public datasets. For practical steps, see the CSV→Library guide and Libraries section.

## IO
::: foodspec.io.loaders
::: foodspec.io.csv_import
::: foodspec.io.exporters

## Data loaders
::: foodspec.data.loader
::: foodspec.data.public
> **Status:** Archived  
> This page has been superseded by the unified API reference. See [API index](../api/index.md) for current IO and data loader APIs.
