Recipes for common tasks: preprocessing tweaks, RQ questions (RQ1–RQ6), validation, reporting, troubleshooting.
# Cookbook intro

This section provides short, task-focused “recipes” answering “How do I…?” for common FoodSpec workflows. Each recipe shows the why, a CLI path, and a Python path, and points to deeper guides if you need them.

## What is a recipe?
- A concise, reproducible set of steps to accomplish one task (e.g., normalize spectra, run batch-aware CV, publish a methods narrative).
- Includes “CLI way” and “Python way” where applicable.
- References relevant protocols and theory docs for context.

## Typical tasks (and where to find them)
- Preprocessing basics: see [cookbook_preprocessing.md](cookbook_preprocessing.md)
- RQ questions (RQ1–RQ6): see [cookbook_rq_questions.md](cookbook_rq_questions.md)
- Validation strategies: see [cookbook_validation.md](cookbook_validation.md)
- Registry and reporting: see [cookbook_registry_reporting.md](cookbook_registry_reporting.md)
- Troubleshooting common issues: see [cookbook_troubleshooting.md](cookbook_troubleshooting.md)
