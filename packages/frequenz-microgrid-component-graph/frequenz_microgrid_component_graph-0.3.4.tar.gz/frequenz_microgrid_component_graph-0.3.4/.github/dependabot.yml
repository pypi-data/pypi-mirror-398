    # We group patch updates as they should always work.
    # We also group minor updates, as it works too for most libraries,
    # typically except libraries that don't have a stable release yet (v0.x.x
    # branch), so we make some exceptions for them.
    # Major updates and dependencies excluded by the above groups are still
    # managed, but they'll create one PR per dependency, as breakage is
    # expected, so it might need manual intervention.
    # Finally, we group some dependencies that are related to each other, and
    # usually need to be updated together.
