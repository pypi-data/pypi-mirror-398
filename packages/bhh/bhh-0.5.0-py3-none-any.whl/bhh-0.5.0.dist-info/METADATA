# How it works

1. Open your Windows Powershell or Command Prompt

2. type 
```batch

pip install bhh

``` 

3. Open your Python IDE or Python Terminal

4. type
```python

import afile
import ahash
import anet

```

5. Now you can use any of the following commands as you wish:

```python
#hash password
hash1 = print(ahash.hash_password("your password"))
print(hash1)

hash2 = print(ahash.hash_password_with_salt("your password", b"your salt"))
print(hash2)

#verify password
print(ahash.verify_password("your password", hash2)) # True or False

#install package
print(anet.install_from_pypi("package name"))

#search web
number_of_outputs = 15
print(anet.search_web("your search", "YOUR_BING_API_KEY", number_of_outputs))

#bind port
port = 1234
print(anet.apos("service path", port, "ip", "homepage"))

#working with files
afile.open_file("path")
afile.delete_file("path")
afile.rename_file("old path", "new path")
afile.write_text("path", "text")
afile.read_text("path")
afile.write_json("path", "data")
afile.read_json("path")

```
