# Quadrupole Analysis

Python functions for taking molecular quadrupole tensors and converting to forms for comparison to literature.

Includes rotating quadrupole into the molecular inertial frame, detracing the quadrupole tensor, and providing tools to empirically compare quadrupoles to literature values.
