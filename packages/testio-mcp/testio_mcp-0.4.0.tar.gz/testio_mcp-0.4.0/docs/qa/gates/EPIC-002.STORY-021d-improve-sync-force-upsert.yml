nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Non-destructive --force mode reduces accidental data loss risk. --nuke requires explicit confirmation."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Upsert strategy (INSERT OR REPLACE) is efficient. Force refresh performance is comparable to incremental sync."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Mutual exclusivity validation prevents conflicting modes. Clear error messages guide users."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code follows established patterns. RefreshResult and RebuildResult dataclasses provide clear contracts. Documentation is comprehensive."
