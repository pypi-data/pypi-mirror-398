gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation quality is high after QA refactoring, but Composer-1 introduced critical test anti-pattern (30-second sleep) requiring intervention. Code is production-ready after fixes."

    finding: "Composer-1 introduced 30-second sleep in timeout unit test causing 1500x slower test execution (30.02s → 0.02s)"

  - id: "TEST-PATTERN-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Integration tests used pytest.skip() placeholders instead of following established project patterns"

evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 16  # 11 unit + 5 integration
  unit_test_performance: "0.03s (1000x improvement from 30.02s)"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Input validation via Pydantic (1-20 test IDs), proper exception sanitization, no token leakage. Security handled by underlying TestIOClient/TestService layers."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "After fixes: Unit tests 0.03s, integration tests 0.38s. Concurrent fetching with 30s timeout and global semaphore protection (ADR-002). No n+1 queries."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling (two-layer pattern), partial failure support, timeout protection. Graceful degradation when some tests fail."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean service layer architecture (ADR-006), proper dependency injection, type-safe (mypy --strict passes), comprehensive docstrings, follows all coding standards."

  immediate:
    - action: "[COMPLETED] Refactor timeout test to avoid 30-second sleep"
      refs: ["tests/unit/test_report_service.py:263-293"]
      status: resolved
    - action: "[COMPLETED] Rewrite integration tests following project patterns"
      refs: ["tests/integration/test_generate_status_report_integration.py"]
      status: resolved
  future:
    - action: "Consider automated performance regression detection for test suites"
      refs: ["CI/CD pipeline"]
      priority: low
    - action: "Review Composer-1 outputs more carefully for anti-patterns before future deployments"
      refs: ["Development process"]
      priority: medium

code_quality_highlights:
  strengths:
    - "Service layer architecture correctly implements ADR-006 with framework-agnostic business logic"
    - "Cross-service communication pattern (ReportService → TestService) demonstrates proper layering"
    - "Three report formats (markdown, text, JSON) with comprehensive formatting and metrics calculation"
    - "Exception handling follows two-layer pattern: service raises domain exceptions, tool converts to MCP format"
    - "Type-safe implementation passes mypy --strict with no type: ignore comments"
    - "Concurrent data fetching with proper timeout and semaphore protection"
    - "Comprehensive test coverage: 11 unit tests + 5 integration tests"
  improvements_made_by_qa:
    - "Timeout test refactored from 35-second sleep to mocked asyncio.wait_for (1000x faster)"
    - "Integration tests rewritten to follow shared_client/shared_cache fixture patterns"
    - "Tests now match conventions from Story-002 and Story-004 implementations"

acceptance_criteria_validation:
  ac0_service_layer: "✓ PASS - ReportService correctly encapsulates business logic"
  ac1_tool_wrapper: "✓ PASS - Tool delegates to service with Context injection (ADR-007)"
  ac2_pydantic_validation: "✓ PASS - Input validation with field validators (1-20 test IDs)"
  ac3_aggregate_data: "✓ PASS - Concurrent fetching via asyncio.gather() with 30s timeout"
  ac4_markdown_format: "✓ PASS - Comprehensive markdown report with all required sections"
  ac5_text_format: "✓ PASS - Plain text format suitable for email/Slack"
  ac6_json_format: "✓ PASS - Valid JSON structure for programmatic consumption"
  ac7_report_logic: "✓ PASS - Metrics calculation, critical issues identification, recommendations"
  ac8_error_handling: "✓ PASS - Two-layer pattern with proper exception conversion"
  ac9_integration_test: "✓ PASS - Comprehensive integration tests with real API patterns (after QA fixes)"

gate_decision_criteria:
  test_coverage: "100% of ACs covered"
  nfr_status: "All PASS"
  issue_severity: "2 high/medium issues found and RESOLVED during review"
  risk_score: "1 high risk (test performance) - RESOLVED"
  gate_logic: "High-severity issues were found but fully resolved by QA. Gate = CONCERNS (advisory) because intervention was required, but code is production-ready."
