# Quality Gate Decision - STORY-007
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "1.7"
story_title: "In-Memory Caching Layer"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive test coverage (18 tests), excellent code quality, and robust stampede protection. No security concerns or blocking issues identified."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

      - "Monitor cache hit rate post-deployment (expect 70%+ under normal usage)"
      - "Review TTL settings if hit rate drops below 50% (per ADR-004)"

# NFR validation - all passed
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security risks. Cache keys are internal, no user input vectors, statistics safe to expose."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Expected 70-90% hit rate. In-memory access <1ms vs 200-500ms API latency. Stampede protection prevents redundant API calls under load."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Thread-safe with asyncio.Lock. Errors not cached. Automatic expiration cleanup. No background tasks."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation with usage examples. Clear separation of concerns. Consistent BaseService patterns. Easy to test."
