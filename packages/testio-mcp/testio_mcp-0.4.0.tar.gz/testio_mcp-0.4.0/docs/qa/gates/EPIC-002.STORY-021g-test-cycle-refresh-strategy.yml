nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Read-only operations with proper error handling."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Hybrid strategy is efficient - skips immutable tests (locked/cancelled) which reduces API calls. Batch refresh with semaphore for concurrency control."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent error handling. Partial failures don't block entire operation. Clear progress reporting for both parts (discovery + update)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of Part A (incremental sync) and Part B (mutable test refresh). Well-documented mutable test criteria. Repository pattern properly extended."
