summary = {
    "rows": 5,
    "columns": {

        "minutes": {"min": 20, "max": 60, "mean": 35, "sum": 175, "dtype": "float64", "nulls": 0},
    },
}

# Example summary (or pandas dataframe)

## How it works

1. Provide a **structured summary** of your dataset.  
2. The library generates a **prompt** and sends it to your LLM (OpenAI or Anthropic).  
3. Receive a **fun, readable Wrapped-style recap** strictly based on your data.
4. Bring your own API key—or let the library pick it up from your local environment.
