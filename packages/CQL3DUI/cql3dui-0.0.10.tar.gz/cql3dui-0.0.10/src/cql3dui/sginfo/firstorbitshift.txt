**  Calculation and output of first order orbit shift
**  
***************************************************************
**
**  ndeltarho=.ne."disabled" means calculate first order radial orbit
**             shifts for the first general species (ions of electrons)
**             from from given local R,Z,v,theta point to the
**             bounce-averaged position of the particle.  Output
**             is given at z-points along B-field measured from
**             the outer equatorial plane as a function of z,rho,theta0
**             (where theta0 is pitch angle at the midplane), and
**             also on a equispace R,Z,theta grid, where theta is local
**             pitch angle.  
**             These quantities with supporting data are output to the 
**             mnemonic.nc netCDF file (deltarho and deltarz arrays,
**             respectively).
**             Multiplying the arrays by v=v0 gives the shift
**             in the normalized minor radius coordinate
**             (as specified by the radcoord setting).
**             The R,Z grid is chosen about 10 percent larger than
**             the LCFS.  (default="disabled")
**
**             The ndeltarho feature is not setup to run with 
**             lrzdiff.ne."disabled".
**
**             ndeltarho can take on several values limiting the
**             application of the 1st order shift in cql3d to specified
**             portions of the code (for testing purposes):
**            ='enabled', then apply to available adjusted portions
**                of cql3d:  that is, urf diffusion, urfdamp1 ray
**                damping, freya NBI source.
**            [Following for testing purposes:]
**            ='urfb0', then just urf diffusion coeff calc
**            ='urfdamp', then just urfdamp of rays
**            ='freya', then just freya NBI source
**             
**             
**
**  nr_delta=number of R-points (default=65)
**  nz_delta=number of Z-points (default=65)
**  nt_delta=number of theta-points (Should be even, default=80)
**
**  A tri-cubic interpolation subroutine (deltar) is provided in
**  in file baviorbt.f, and can be used with the deltarz data,
**  and can be used as a template for adjusting external diagnostic
**  routines.
