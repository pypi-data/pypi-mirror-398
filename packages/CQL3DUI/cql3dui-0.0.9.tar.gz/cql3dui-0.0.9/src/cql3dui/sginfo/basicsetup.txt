**  mnemonic is the run designator...to help keep track of runs. 
**    for example: mnemonic="wy01"
**    mnemonic is dimensioned a48, 
**                       i.e., ok for up to 48 characters.
**    Used as prefix to output PS and netCDF files.
**    default: mnemonic="mnemonic"
**
**  ioutput(1)  [After 2020-10-21]
**    ioutput(1)=0  means the printout to screen is reduced to a minimum,
**                  leaving namelist printout, warning messages,
**                  and physics-related values used or computed by code.
**    ioutput(1)=1  The above, and more printout - 
**                  values of arrays for diagnostic purpose.
**    ioutput(1)=2 (or .ge.2) The above, and even more diagnostic printout.
**                  (default value ioutput(1)=0).
**  ioutput(2)=0 ! No usage at present [2020]
**    default: ioutput(1:2)=0  NOTE: Old cqlinput files could have 
**                                   ioutput.ne.0.
**
**  iuser ="name" of user or "number" of user (no present use).
**
**  ibox="box ***" where *** is user's box number (no present use).
**
**  Parameters are set in param.h giving maximum dimensions
**    of variables used in the code.  The code may be run
**    with dimensions which are less than the input parameters,
**    as specified below by namelist variables lrz, lrzmax,
**    ls, lsmax, (and others,) as specified below.
**
**    The parameter machinea specifies the size of integer words:
**       (=1, for 8 byte integers, =2, for 4 byte integers).
**
**  lrz is the number of radial flux surfaces in the computational
**    grid on which Fokker-Planck equation is solved.
**
**  lrzdiff="enabled", compute distribution functions on subset
**    of the flux surfaces considered. 
**    This system was setup to reduce computational time, when
**    only interested in few of the FP surfaces, but want to specify
**    the radial profile of background species on a more refined lrzmax
**    grid.  (default="disabled")
**
**  lrzmax is number of flux surfaces, including any not FP'd.
**    lrzmax=1, then this gives single flux surface runs with no input
**           of profiles
**    lrzmax.ge.4 uses input profiles of density, etc.
**    (lrzmax=2,3 to be avoided, and problems with some cubic splines.)
**    lrzmax is set =lrz, if lrzdiff.ne."enabled"
**
**  lrindx(1:lrz)=indices of flux surfaces where the FP'ing is
**    performed.
**    (if lrz=lrzmax, i.e., all flux surfaces are to be FP'ed, 
**    then it is unnecessary to specify lrzmax, lrindx, and lrzdiff).
**  
**  noplots="enabled1" inhibits all plots.
**    default: noplots="disabled" 
**    [="enabled" inhibits old unimplemented graflib plots, and was
**     necessary for code to run, but now all old graflib replaced.
**     so it should have same effect as "disabled", BH and YuP, 120122]
**    noplots="enabled1"  can be useful to load the code without 
**    a pgplot library.
**    The -Wl,-noinhibit-exec gnu loader (ld) option exists in gfortran
**    which enables loading of the code in the presence of unsatisfied
**    externals.  With noplots='enabled', the references to pgplot
**    routines in the code will be avoided.  Similar options exist
**    for several other compiler groups.
**
**  lnwidth=line-width attribute for plotting; affects lines, graph
**          markers, and text.  Specified in units of 0.005 in, and
**          must be an integer.  [default=3]
**          [Smaller value may work better for vector plots.]
**          Conversion from .ps to .pdf using ps2pdf improves the plot.
**
**
**  nmlstout="enabled", prints namelists to stdout
**           "trnscrib", transcribes the cqlinput nml file to stdout
**            else,   suppress this output.
**            default:  nmlstout="trnscrib"
**
**  special_calls="enabled", then code makes system calls to find
**                name of system and pwd, for output.   This is not
**                allowed on some systems.
**               ="external", then files uname_output and pwd_output
**                are used to printout.  These many be created with
**                an external script containing
**                uname -a > uname_output
**                pwd > pwd_output
**               ="disabled", then no system calls and no reference
**                to uname_output and pwd_output files.
**                This gets around lack of some special functions,
**                e.g., second(), with some compilers.
**               default="enabled"
**
**  nlwritf="enabled"  saves the distribution function at the end of 
**               the run (in file distrfunc).   default="disabled"
**         ="ncdfdist", don't write distn function into text file
**               distrfunc, since can use mnemonic.nc save of f.
**               This file also contains much additional data, some
**               of which is needed with some restart options.
**               Text distrfunc will contain only namelist and profiles
**               at the end of the run.
**               Don't use netcdfshort.ne."disabled", if going to 
**               use nlrestrt.
**  nlrestrt="enabled" reads the initial distribution function in 
**               text file 'distrfunc'.           default="disabled"
**               The general restart idea is that only data from end
**               of the previous run which is not specified in the
**               continuing namelist file, needs to be restored.
**          ="ncdfdist" reads the distribution function from a
**               netcdf file, 'distrfunc.nc'.  This file can be
**               the mnemonic.nc file from a previous run.
**               The text file 'distrfunc' is still needed  (NOT as of 110201), 
**               but only for reading namelist from &setup and others (except %setup0),
**               ensuring compatibility of grids, etc.  (Can change
**               mnemonic in &setup0.)
**               Reading of text distrfunc for nlrestrt='ncdfdist' or
**               'ncregrid' discontinued (BH110201).
**               BH181023: If ampfmod="enabled" then also read in prior 
**               ending value of elecfld().
**               BH+YuP191029: If iprozeff='curr_fit', then also restore 
**               prior ending value of the zeff profile.
**          ='ncregrid', same as 'ncdfdist', except the momentum-per-
**               mass grid can be reset from that used in distrfunc.nc,
**               by changing enorm, jx and xfac (only enabled changes
**               presently, not iy or lrz) in cqlinput.  If enorm/vnorm
**               is increased, the distrn for distrfunc.nc is extrapolated
**               linearly in ln(f) versus v(mom-per-mass).  Portions of the 
**               distn fnctn in distrfunc.nc within the bounds of the
**               new x() grid specified by the namelist input are 
**               interpolated onto the new grid. The FSA density of the
**               new code distribution is maintained equal to the
**               restart distribution function in the .nc file.
**               enorm/vnorm can be either increased or decreased from
**               the value in the distrfunc.nc file.
**               Reading of distrfunc text file for nlrestrt='ncdfdist' or
**               'ncregrid' discontinued (BH110201).
**               BH181023: If ampfmod="enabled" then also read in prior 
**               ending value of elecfld().
**           NB: The nlrestrt option is presently (181023) setup only
**               for a single general species (ngen=1).
