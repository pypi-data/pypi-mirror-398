"""
Dependency Verification Module
==============================

Checks that critical runtime dependencies meet the required versions.
Implements the "Fail Gently" philosophy by guiding users to upgrade instead of crashing hard.

Usage:
    if not verify_dependencies(): sys.exit(1)

Key Checks:
    - playwright-stealth >= 2.0.0
    - playwright >= 1.56.0 (or base compatible)

Key Outputs:
    - Boolean (True if all good, False if missing/old).
    - Printed instructions for the user.
