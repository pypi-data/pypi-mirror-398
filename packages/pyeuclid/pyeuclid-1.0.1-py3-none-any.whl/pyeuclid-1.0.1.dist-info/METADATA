# [#259] PyEuclid: A Versatile Formal Plane Geometry System in Python

## Claimed Badges
Available badge, functional badge, and reusable badge

## Computational Recourses
We conduct our experiments on a server running Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS with an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX processor, utilizing 30 CPU cores in parallel (2 cores per process, each allocated 4 GB of memory). On this setup, experiments on the JGEX-AG-231 dataset take approximately 2 hours to complete, while the Geometry3K dataset takes around 1 hour.

Additionally, we run sequential experiments on an Apple MacBook Pro with an M3 chip, using 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of memory. On this setup, processing the Geometry3K dataset takes approximately 7~8 hours.

```

## Installation
You can get started with PyEuclid using Docker *or* a local installation.

### From PyPI
```bash
pip install pyeuclid
```
Note: benchmark datasets (`data/`) and `cache.tar.gz` are **not** bundled with the PyPI package. Install from source if you need the datasets for experiments.

You can either build the Docker image locally or pull it from Docker Hub:
```bash
# Build the Docker image locally
docker build -t pyeuclid .
# Alternatively, pull the image from Docker Hub
docker pull dahubao/pyeuclid
# After obtaining the image, run
docker run -it pyeuclid bash
```

To install PyEuclid locally *without* Docker, run:
```bash
conda create -n pyeuclid python=3.11 -y
conda activate pyeuclid
cd PyEuclid
pip install .
tar -xvzf cache.tar.gz
```

After installation, verify that everything is working by running:
```bash
python test_single.py --help
python test_single.py --show-proof
```

If you see output like `Solved in 8.90s`, the setup is successful.



Note:
PyEuclid uses Gurobi as a component of its proof generator.
To solve more complex problems, you may need a [Gurobi academic license](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/), as the free version has a limit of 2000 variables and constraints, which may not be sufficient for certain cases.


## Evaluation
We provide both sequential and parallel methods to run experiments on the JGEX-AG-231 and Geometry3K datasets:
```bash
python test.py                            # Run sequentially on a single machine
sbatch slurm.sh                           # Run in parallel on a compute cluster via SLURM
```

## Releasing to PyPI
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). To publish a new release:
1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml` and `pyeuclid/__init__.py`.
2. Commit the changes and create a tag that matches the version (e.g., `v1.0.1`).
3. Push the tag: `git push origin v1.0.1`.
4. GitHub Actions will build, check, and upload the package to PyPI, then create a GitHub release (requires `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret).

## Extension
If you would like to improve the reasoning ability of PyEuclid, one straightforward way is to add more complex inference rule at `pyeuclid/engine/inference_rule.py`. Here is an example:
```python
@register('complex')
class AreaHeronFormula(InferenceRule):
    def __init__(self, a: Point, b: Point, c: Point):
        super().__init__()
        self.a = a
        self.b = b
        self.c = c

    def condition(self):
        return [NotCollinear(self.a, self.b, self.c), Different(self.a, self.b, self.c), Lt(self.a, self.b), Lt(self.b, self.c)]

    def conclusion(self):
        s = (Length(self.a, self.b)+Length(self.a, self.c)+Length(self.b, self.c))/2
        return [Area(self.a, self.b, self.c)**2-(s*(s-Length(self.a, self.b))*(s-Length(self.a, self.c))*(s-Length(self.b, self.c)))]
```
You need to specify the condition and conclusion of the inference rule. The Lt relation defines a partial order on the names of the points to reduce equivalent permutations of the inference rule.

We also provide an interactive interface that allows PyEuclid to collaborate with a human user or a Large-Language-Model (LLM) agent.
You can explicitly trigger a reasoning step by calling:
```python
engine.step(conditions, conclusions)
```
PyEuclid will verify both the conditions and the desired conclusions, and automatically apply the appropriate theorems or algebraic equations to derive the conclusions from the given conditions.
