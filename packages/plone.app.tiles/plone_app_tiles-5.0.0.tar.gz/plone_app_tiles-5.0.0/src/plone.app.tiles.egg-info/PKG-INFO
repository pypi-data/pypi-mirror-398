Plone's Specific Implementation of Tiles
========================================

``plone.app.tiles`` is Plone's UI integration for `plone.tiles <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.tiles>`_.

This package contains the following things:

* A view ``@@add-tile``, and an associated form, which can be used to create a new tile based on the tile's schema.
  For transient tiles, this merely redirects to a URL with an appropriate query string.
  For persistent tiles, it will also save the necessary data.
  This will fire an ``IObjectCreatedEvent`` as well as an ``IObjectAddedEvent`` for the newly created tile (a transient object) when successfully submitted.
  In the case of the ``IObjectAddedEvent``, the ``newParent`` attribute will be the tile's context, and the ``newName`` attribute will be the tile's id.

* The ``@@add-tile`` view, when accessed directly, allows the user to choose from all available tiles
  (subject to the tile's add permission)
  and redirects to the appropriate ``@@add-tile/<tile-type>`` URL to configure the tile.

* A view ``@@edit-tile``, and an associated form, which can be used to edit a tile based on the tile's schema.
  This will fire an ``IObjectModifiedEvent`` for the modified tile (a transient object) when successfully submitted.

* A view ``@@delete-tile``, and associated form, which can be used to delete a tile and associated persistent data.
  This can also be called by AJAX code given appropriate request parameters.
  This will fire an ``IObjectRemovedEvent`` for the removed tile (a transient object).
  The ``oldParent`` attribute will be the tile's context, and the ``oldName`` attribute will be the tile's id.

* A vocabulary ``plone.app.tiles.RegisteredTiles``, which contains all
  registered tile types.

* A vocabulary ``plone.app.tiles.AvailableTiles``, which contains all
  registered tile types, which have been registered for the current context.

* A vocabulary ``plone.app.tiles.AllowedTiles``, which contains all
  registered tile types, which have been registered for the current context,
  and, which are currently allowed to be added (for which the current
  user has required add permission).

The default add and edit forms should suffice for most use cases.
You can use `plone.autoform <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.autoform>`_ to configure alternative widgets.

If you need a custom form,
you can register an add view as an adapter from ``(context, request, tileType)``,
where ``tileType`` is an instance providing ``plone.tiles.interfaces.ITileType``.

The actual integration of the various views is left up to other packages (such as the Mosaic editor).

5.0.0 (2025-12-23)
------------------

Breaking changes:


- Replace ``pkg_resources`` namespace with PEP 420 native namespace.
  Support only Plone 6.2 and Python 3.10+.
  @petschki


Internal:


- Update configuration files.
  [plone devs]


4.0.2 (2025-06-19)

Internal:


- Configure package with plone/meta
  [petschki] (#0)
- Remove deprecated plone.app.tiles registry record from the demo profile.
  [thet]
- Update configuration files.
  [plone devs]


4.0.1 (2023-12-14)
------------------

- Use ``ScalesDict`` instead of ``PersistentDict`` to store scales in persistent tiles.
  This avoids ``plone.protect`` warning about write-on-read.
  Migrate the storage on-the-fly, just like ``plone.scale`` does.
  [maurits]


4.0.0 (2022-12-02)
------------------

- Add support for Plone 6 on Python 3.10 and 3.11.  [maurits]


4.0.0a2 (2022-07-20)
--------------------

- Register our demo tiles when you explicitly load ``demo.zcml``.
  Add them to the list in ``plone.app.tiles`` and ``plone.app.mosaic``.
  [maurits]

- Accept a fieldname in ``get_original_value`` in our scaling code.
  Needed for recent plone.namedfile versions.
  [maurits]


4.0.0a1 (2022-03-09)
--------------------

- Register our own ``IImageScaleFactory`` factory for persistent tiles.
  This fixes scaling images on tiles when the tile does not have the workaround of defining a property for the image field.
  [maurits]

- Register our ``AnnotationStorage`` as ``IImageScaleStorage`` factory.
  We require ``plone.namedfile >= 6.0.0a2`` for this.
  Fixes `issue 48 <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.tiles/issues/48>`_.  [maurits]

- Drop support for Python 2 and Plone 5.1.
  Plone 5.2 and 6.0 are supported, on Python 3.
  See `issue 49 <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.tiles/issues/49>`_.  [maurits]


3.3.0 (2022-02-04)
------------------

Features:

- Define ``download`` and ``display-file`` views that work for tiles.
  The original views in ``plone.namedfile`` cannot find the tile data.
  [maurits]

Bug fixes:

- Fixed getting original image from tile.
  Until now, the ``images`` view tried to get the field from the tile instead of the tile data.
  This only worked when you had explicitly added a property with this field name on the tile.
  [maurits]


3.2.3 (2022-01-28)
------------------

- Removed ``plone.namedfile[blobs]`` from the ``test`` extra.
  This has been empty since ``plone.namedfile`` 2.0, used since Plone 4.3.0.
  [maurits]


3.2.2 (2021-12-21)
------------------

Features:

- test with github actions
  [petschki]

Bug fixes:

- Fix imagescaling: missing srcset initialization, and
  wrong scale arguments (according to latest p.namedfile).
  Add test for imagescaling.
  [mamico]

- Fix class security declaration warnings for add/edit/delete views
  [petschki]


3.2.1 (2020-09-26)
------------------

- Fix ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'App.class_init' on Zope 5.
  [agitator]

  form

  [thet]


3.0.0 (2016-09-15)
------------------

Breaking changes:

  it was not use by default and each tiles may have its own add permission
  and use existing permissions like ``cmf.ModifyPortalContent``.
  [datakurre]

- Deprecate registry record ``plone.app.tiles``. The registry
  record is still registered, but not used by plone.app.tiles
  [datakurre]

New features:

- Add CMFEditions modifier to prevent (previously broken) versioning of blobs
  and relations in persistent tile data (in annotations); Whenever a previous
  version is restored, the blob and relation versions from the current
  working copy version are applied for the restored version
  [datakurre]

- Add new vocabularies *plone.app.tiles.RegisteredTiles*,
  *plone.app.tiles.AvailableTiles* and *plone.app.tiles.AllowedTiles* to
  list all registered tiles, tiles available in the current context
  and tiles allowed to be added in the current context by the current user

  plone.app.drafts.interfaces.IDisplayFormDrafting
  (requires plone.app.drafts >= 1.1.0)

------------------

- Remove unnecessary dependency on plone.app.blocks
  [datakurre]

  layout field; Fixed to sync all drafted tiles instead
  [datakurre]
