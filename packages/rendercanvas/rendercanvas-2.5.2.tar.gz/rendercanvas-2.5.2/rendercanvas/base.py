    This base class defines a uniform canvas API so render systems can use code
    that is portable across multiple GUI libraries and canvas targets. The
    scheduling mechanics are generic, even though they run on different backend
    event systems.

    Arguments:
        size (tuple): the logical size (width, height) of the canvas.
        title (str): The title of the canvas. Can use '$backend' to show the RenderCanvas class name,
            '$fps' to show the fps, and '$ms' to show the frame-time.
        update_mode (UpdateMode): The mode for scheduling draws and events. Default 'ondemand'.
        min_fps (float): A minimal frames-per-second to use when the ``update_mode`` is 'ondemand'. The default is 0:
        max_fps (float): A maximal frames-per-second to use when the ``update_mode`` is 'ondemand'
            or 'continuous'. The default is 30, which is usually enough.
        vsync (bool): Whether to sync the draw with the monitor update. Helps
            against screen tearing, but limits the fps. Default True.
        present_method (str | None): Override the method to present the rendered result.
            Can be set to 'screen' or 'bitmap'. Default None, which means that the method is selected
            based on what the canvas supports and what the context prefers.

        A canvas backend must implement at least either "screen" or "bitmap".

        With method "bitmap", the context will present the result as an image
        bitmap. For the `WgpuContext`, the result will first be rendered to texture,
