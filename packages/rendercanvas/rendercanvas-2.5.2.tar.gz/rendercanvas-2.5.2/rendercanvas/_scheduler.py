    # This class makes the canvas tick. Since we do not own the event-loop, but
    # ride on e.g. Qt, asyncio, wx, JS, or something else, we need to abstract the loop.
    # We implement it as an async function, that way we can cleanly support async event
    # handlers. Note, however, that the draw-event cannot be async, so it does not
    # fit well into the loop. An event is used to wait for it.
    #
    # We have to make sure that there is only one invocation of the scheduler task,
    # or we'd get double the intended FPS.
    #
    # After a draw is requested, we wait for it to happen, otherwise
    # the drawing may not keep up with the ticking.
    #
    # On desktop canvases the draw usually occurs very soon after it is
    # requested, but on remote frame buffers, it may take a bit longer,
    # which may cause a laggy feeling.
    #
    # When the window is minimized, the draw will not occur until the window is
    # shown again. For the canvas to detect minimized-state, it will need to
    # receive GUI events. This is one of the reasons why the loop object also
    # runs a loop-task.
    #
    # The drawing itself may take longer than the intended wait time. In that
    # case, it will simply take longer than we hoped and get a lower fps.
    #
    # Note that any extra draws, e.g. via force_draw() or due to window resizes,
    # don't affect the scheduling loop; they are just extra draws.
