Prediction: The exact prediction or foresight made by the historical figure\n2. Context: The circumstances, time period, or situation in which the prediction was made\n3. Outcome: What actually happened, if known, and how it relates to the prediction\n\nFormat your response using the following structure:\n<prediction>\n[Prediction text here]\n</prediction>\n\n<context>\n[Context information here]\n</context>\n\n<outcome>\n[Outcome information here, or "Unknown" if not available]\n</outcome>\n\nIf multiple predictions are found in the input text, format each one sequentially. Ensure that each prediction, context, and outcome section is clearly separated and contains only the relevant information.\n\nBe thorough in your analysis but concise in your extraction. Focus on verifiable predictions rather than general statements or opinions.'
