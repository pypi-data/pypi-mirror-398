# Git Dates Modifier

## 📌 Overview
Git Dates Modifier, a Python script to rewrite commit dates (author date and committer date) selectively based on commit message matching. It supports separate modification of AuthorDate and CommitterDate for each matched commit.

## ✨ Features
- Read the repository commit history and display AuthorDate and CommitterDate.
- Interactively specify new Author and/or Committer dates for each commit.
- Support using `now` to set the date to the current time.
- Preview planned changes before rewriting history.
- Uses `git-filter-repo` for safe and flexible history rewriting.

## ⚠️ Important Warning
**This script rewrites Git history**. Rewriting history will change commit SHAs and can cause problems for collaborators or any public branches. Make a backup and ensure you understand the consequences before running the script. Prefer using this on local branches or repositories where you can force-push and coordinate with other contributors.

## 🧩 Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+ (or a Python 3.x environment).
2. `git` available on your PATH.
3. `git-filter-repo` Python package installed. Install with:

    ```bash
    pip install git-filter-repo
    ```

## 🛠 Installation / Setup

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)
Install from PyPI, for example, using pip:

```bash
pip install git-dates-modifier
```

After installation, run it inside any git repository:

```bash
git-dates-modifier
```

> Make sure the installation path of `pip` is included in your `PATH`.

### Option 2: Run from source
Copy the [script](git_dates_modifier/main.py) and place the script at the root of your git repository.

Ensure the script is executable or run it with Python. The script checks for a `.git` folder in the current working directory and will fail if not executed from a repo root.

## ▶️ Usage
Run the script from your repository root:

```bash
git-dates-modifier
```

The script will:
1. Read commits (in chronological order).
2. Prompt you for new **Author Date** and **Committer Date** for each commit.
    - Press Enter to keep the original date.
    - Enter `now` to use the current time.
    - Use a date/time string in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (example: `2025-10-24 11:22:33`).
3. Build a mapping of commit messages → date changes.
4. Show a preview of planned changes.
5. Ask for confirmation before executing `git-filter-repo` to rewrite history.

### Example prompt responses
- To skip changes for a commit: press Enter at both prompts.
- To update only the Author date: supply value only for the Author prompt.
- To set both dates to now: enter `now` at both prompts.

## 🧯 Safety & Troubleshooting
- **Backup first**: create a clone or branch backup: `git clone --mirror . /path/to/backup` or `git branch backup-YYYYMMDD`
- If `git-filter-repo` is missing, the script exits with a helpful instruction to install it.
- If the script fails during `git-filter-repo`, the error will be printed. Investigate the message and restore from your backup if necessary.
- The script uses exact message matching. If multiple commits share the same message body, they will receive the same changes.

## 📤 After Rewriting
Verify the new dates locally:

```bash
git log --format=fuller --date=iso
```

When ready to publish the rewritten history, force-push (with caution):

```bash
git push --force --all
```

Coordinate with any collaborators to avoid conflicts.

## 🌐 Encoding & Timezones
- Input date strings should be in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format. The script tries to parse that and append the local timezone offset.
- `now` sets the date to the current local time and includes the local timezone offset.
