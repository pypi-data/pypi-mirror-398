bouquin-sqlcipher4
==========

*NOTICE*: This is a fork of [sqlcipher3-wheels](https://github.com/laggykiller/sqlcipher3),
itself a fork of https://github.com/coleifer/sqlcipher3.

This one is intended for my Bouquin tool and is up to date with latest SQLCipher 4 (it also
reuses the SQLCipher 4 version number to be aligned with it at all times).

The main motivation of the 'fork' is just to bring SQLCipher up to date and also to package
it for Debian in my apt repo. This unblocks me to package Bouquin for Debian in my apt repo
too.
