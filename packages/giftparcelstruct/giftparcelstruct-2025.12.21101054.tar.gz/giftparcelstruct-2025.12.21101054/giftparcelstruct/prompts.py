human_prompt = 'Here’s a gift-wrapped parcel description for you to analyze:\n---\n*"The parcel is swathed in a vibrant, crinkled gold foil with a delicate lace bow tied in a loose, asymmetrical knot. The wrapping feels surprisingly sturdy despite its delicate appearance, and there’s a faint scent of vanilla and sandalwood. Inside, the box is lined with crumpled tissue paper that smells like fresh-cut grass. The lid is slightly ajar, revealing a small, irregularly shaped object wrapped in a single layer of soft, blue velvet. The corners of the velvet are frayed, as if it’s been handled often, and there’s a tiny, handwritten note tucked under the wrapping paper that reads: \'For someone who loves secrets.\'*\n\nAnalyze this parcel description in detail. Provide a structured breakdown of:\n1. **Contents** (describe what you *think* is inside, including size, shape, and any clues from the wrapping).\n2. **Wrapping Quality** (evaluate the aesthetic, texture, and craftsmanship—e.g., "luxurious," "rustic," "sloppy," "minimalist").\n3. **Potential Surprises** (highlight anything unexpected, ambiguous, or intriguing—e.g., "The note suggests a personal touch," "The velvet could hide something delicate").\n4. **Vibe/Mood** (a one-sentence summary of the parcel’s emotional tone or atmosphere, e.g., "whimsical and nostalgic").\n\nFormat your response clearly, with each section labeled and separated by double newlines.\n---'
