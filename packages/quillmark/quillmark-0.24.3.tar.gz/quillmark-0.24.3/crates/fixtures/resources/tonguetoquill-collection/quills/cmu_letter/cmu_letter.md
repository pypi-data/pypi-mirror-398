Dear [Recipient's Salutation],

Write your letter content here. This template uses the CMU letter format for professional academic correspondence.

You can organize your thoughts with bullet points:

- First point with supporting details and context.

- Second point to address additional matters or provide supplementary information.

Use additional paragraphs to develop your ideas fully and maintain clear communication.

You can also **bold**, _italicize_, __underline__, and `code` your text as needed.

Sincerely,
