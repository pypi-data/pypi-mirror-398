class DynamicUint:

    An unsigned integer with a dynamic size.

    This class is implemented in C++ as a sequence of any number of 32-bit integers and can thus be used to represent
    arbitrarily large integer values. Note that the number of 32-bit integer parts needs to be manually adjusted. If the
    integer gets too large to hold with the current size, an overflow will occur. Any interaction with instances of this
    class and python integers will work properly only for integers with up to 32 bits.
