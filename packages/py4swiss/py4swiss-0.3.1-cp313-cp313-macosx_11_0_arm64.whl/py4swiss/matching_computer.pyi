    A class that implements the Blossom algorithm for computing a maximum weight matching in a general graph.

    The Blossom algorithm finds a matching that maximizes the sum of the edge weights while ensuring that each vertex is
    incident to at most one matched edge. This implementation supports dynamically adding vertices, setting edge
    weights, and retrieving optimal matchings. Note that this implementation treats edge weights of 0 as if there was no
    edge to begin with. This is implemented in its entirety in C++ and includes functionality for the efficient update
    of weights.
