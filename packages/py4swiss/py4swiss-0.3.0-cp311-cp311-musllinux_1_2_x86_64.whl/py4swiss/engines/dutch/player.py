    # It can be determined for each player who has played at least one game.
    # a. An absolute colour preference occurs when a player's colour difference is greater than +1 or less than -1, or
    #    when a player had the same colour in the two latest rounds he played. The preference is white when the colour
    #    difference is less than -1 or when the last two games were played with black. The preference is black when the
    #    colour difference is greater than +1, or when the last two games were played with white.
    # b. A strong colour preference occurs when a player's colour difference is +1 (preference for black) or -1
    #    (preference for white).
    # c. A mild colour preference occurs when a player's colour difference is zero, the preference being to alternate
    #    the colour with respect to the previous game he played.
    # d. Players who did not play any games have no colour preference (the preference of their opponents is granted).
