*py4swiss* is a python package for pairing Swiss-system chess tournaments.

The code is heavily inspired by [bbpPairings](https://github.com/BieremaBoyzProgramming/bbpPairings)
and also directly utitlizes the maximum weight matching algorithm implemented there.

Supports Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and macOS.

## 📄 Tournament Report File

For generation of pairings, an input file containing the entire history of the tournament up until this point is
required.
This file needs to be a **TRF(x)** as defined by the
[javafo User Manual](https://www.rrweb.org/javafo/aum/JaVaFo2_AUM.htm).

When parsing, malformed lines (with an incomplete or invalid code) will be skipped by default.
Use `--strict` to enable stricter parsing, if desired.

Note that unlike *javafo*, if no initial color is provided, *py4swiss* will default to `white1` instead of choosing
randomly.

## 📦 Installation

You can install this package directly from PyPI using `pip` via

```bash
pip install py4swiss
```

If you prefer, you can also install the latest version from the source repository via

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moritz72/py4swiss.git
cd py4swiss
pip install .
```

Pre-built binary files for each supported OS are also available in the
[Releases section](https://github.com/Moritz72/py4swiss/releases).

## ⚙ Usage

To generate pairings for a given tournament, run

```bash
py4swiss -t <trf-file>
```

Additional arguments can be specified for more precise control.

| Argument         | Description                             | Default        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| `-e, --engine`   | Pairing engine                          | `dutch`        |
| `-p, --pairings` | Output file for pairings                | `pairings.txt` |
| `-s, --strict`   | Enable strict parsing mode              | `False`        |

## 🧩 Variants

### FIDE Dutch System

Pairing engine: `dutch`

This variant implements the [(Swiss) Dutch System](https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/C0403Till2026) (until 2026)
rules by FIDE.
It was tested against and produces results identical to
[bbpPairings](https://github.com/BieremaBoyzProgramming/bbpPairings).

### FIDE Dubov System

Pairing engine: `dubov`

This variant implements the [(Swiss) Dubov System](https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/C040401202602) (from 2026)
rules by FIDE.
It was tested against and produces results identical to
[CPPDubovSystem](https://github.com/MichaelVShapiro/CPPDubovSystem) in most cases.
Note, however, that neither implementation is mature at this point in time.

### FIDE Burstein System

Pairing engine: `burstein`

This variant implements the [(Swiss) Burstein System](https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/C040402202602) (from 2026)
rules by FIDE.
Note, however, that this implementation is not mature at this point in time.

## 🧪 Tests

In order to run some tests, `bbpPairings.exe` as well as `CPPDubovSystem` need to be in the environment.
You can download `bbpPairings.exe` directly from
[here](https://github.com/BieremaBoyzProgramming/bbpPairings/releases/tag/v5.0.1)
while `CPPDubovSystem` needs to be built from [source](https://github.com/MichaelVShapiro/CPPDubovSystem).

After that you can run the tests using `pytest`.
