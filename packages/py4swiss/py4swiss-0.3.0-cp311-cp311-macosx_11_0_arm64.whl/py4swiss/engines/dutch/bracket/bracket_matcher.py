    Choose the best available candidate. In order to do so, consider that a candidate is better than another if it
    better satisfies a quality criterion (C5-C19) of higher priority; or, all quality criteria being equally satisfied,
    it is generated earlier than the other one in the sequence of the candidates (see B.6 or B.7).

    To determine the order of generation, additional updates need to be performed after initiation.
