        # 3.2.1 Preparation
        #     The pairing of a bracket is composed of pairs and outgoing floaters.
        #     Determine the maximum number of pairs that can be obtained in the current bracket while complying with
        #     criteria from [C1] to [C5] (see Articles 2.1.1 to 2.3.1).
        #     This automatically determines the number of outgoing floaters.
        # 3.2.2 Operations
        #     Choose the first pairing (as ordered according to Article 4) that complies best with all the pairing
        #     criteria ([C1] to [C8], see Articles 2.1 to 2.3).
        #     Consider that a pairing is better than another if it better satisfies a quality criterion ([C5]-[C8], see
        #     Article 2.3) of higher priority.

        # FIDE handbook: "4. Order of Pairings"
        # 4.1 All players in the bracket shall be tagged with consecutive in-bracket sequence-numbers (BSN for short)
        #     representing their respective ranking order (according to Article 1.8) in the bracket (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4,
        #     ...).
        # 4.2 The bracket is then extended, adding a number of virtual players equal to the number of outgoing floaters
        #     (see [C5], Article 2.3.1). All those virtual players are assigned a BSN equal to zero, meaning that their
        #     opponent shall float.
        # 4.3 In order to sort all the possible pairings, apply the following rule: a pairing precedes another if its
        #     BSN #1's opponent has a larger BSN (i.e. lower ranking) than the other's. If BSN #1's opponents are the
        #     same, then compare BSN #2's opponents; and so on.
