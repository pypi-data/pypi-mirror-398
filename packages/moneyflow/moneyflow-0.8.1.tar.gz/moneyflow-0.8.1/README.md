## Troubleshooting

### Login fails with "Incorrect password"

- Enter your **encryption password** (for moneyflow), not your backend password
- If forgotten: Click "Reset Credentials" or delete `~/.moneyflow/`

### Monarch Money - 2FA not working

- Copy the BASE32 secret (long string), not the QR code
- Get fresh secret: Disable and re-enable 2FA in Monarch Money

### YNAB - Connection fails

- Verify your Personal Access Token is correct
- Token may have expired - generate a new one from YNAB Developer Settings
- Make sure you copied the entire token (no spaces before/after)
- Token is only shown once - if lost, generate a new one

### Terminal displays weird characters

- Use a modern terminal with Unicode support (iTerm2, GNOME Terminal, Windows Terminal)

### Complete reset

```bash
rm -rf ~/.moneyflow/
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall moneyflow
moneyflow
```
