2. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
3. **Disable** existing 2FA, then **re-enable** it

---

## Initial Setup

### 1. Launch moneyflow

```bash
moneyflow
```

On first run, you'll be prompted to select a backend:

![Backend selection](../assets/screenshots/backend-select.svg)

Select **Monarch Money**.

### 2. Enter Monarch Money Credentials

You'll see the credential setup screen:

![Credential setup screen](../assets/screenshots/monarch-credentials.svg)

Enter:

- **Email**: Your Monarch Money login email
- **Password**: Your Monarch Money password
- **2FA Secret**: The BASE32 secret key from above

### 3. Create Encryption Password

Create a NEW password to encrypt your stored credentials:

- Only for moneyflow (not your Monarch Money password)
- Needed every time you launch
- Minimum 8 characters

!!! info
    Credentials encrypted with AES-128/PBKDF2 (100k iterations) at `~/.moneyflow/credentials.enc`

### 4. Initial Data Load

moneyflow will:

1. Authenticate with Monarch Money
2. Fetch your transactions (batches of 1000)
3. Download categories and account metadata
4. Build the initial view

This takes 10-30 seconds depending on transaction count.

---

## Subsequent Runs

After initial setup, launching moneyflow only requires your **encryption password**:

```bash
moneyflow
# Enter encryption password: ********
# Loading...
```

moneyflow will:

- Decrypt your stored credentials
- Authenticate with Monarch Money
- Load your latest transaction data

---

## Editing Transactions

All edits sync back to Monarch Money immediately after commit. See the [Editing Guide](editing.md) for full details.

---

## Reset Credentials

If you forget your encryption password or want to reconfigure:

### Option 1: Reset from Unlock Screen

1. Launch `moneyflow`
2. Click **"Reset Credentials"** on the unlock screen
3. Re-enter your Monarch Money credentials

### Option 2: Manual Reset

Delete the credentials file and restart:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.moneyflow/
moneyflow
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Incorrect password" when unlocking

- You're entering the **encryption password** (the one YOU created for moneyflow)
- **Not** your Monarch Money password
- If you forgot it, click "Reset Credentials"

### "Authentication failed" during login

- Check your Monarch Money email and password
- Verify your 2FA secret is correct
- Try logging into Monarch Money web UI to ensure your account is active

### "Session expired" errors

moneyflow maintains a session with Monarch Money that expires after
~24 hours. moneyflow should recreate the session automatically, but if
you still see session errors:

1. Restart moneyflow - it will automatically re-authenticate
2. If that doesn't work, try resetting credentials

If you see session errors repeatedly, please [open a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/wesm/moneyflow/issues).

### Slow startup

Caching is enabled by default, so subsequent startups should be fast. If startup is slow:

- Use `--year 2025` to limit data to the current year
- Use `--refresh` to force a fresh download if cache seems stale

---

## Data Privacy & Security

Credentials encrypted locally. Data only sent to Monarch Money. See [Security Documentation](https://github.com/wesm/moneyflow/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
