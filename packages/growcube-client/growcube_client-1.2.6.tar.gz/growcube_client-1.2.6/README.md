This is an asyncio Python library to communicate with [Elecrow GrowCube](https://shrsl.com/4qit4) devices.
__Disclosure__: This is an affiliate link for [Hands on Katie](https://handsonkatie.com). If you make a purchase through this link, she may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you.

By using this library you can communicate directly with the device, without the need to use the phone app.

Once connected to a device, the library will listen for messages from the device and use a callback function
to return parsed messages to the application. The application can also send commands to the device.

## Installation

```
pip install growcube-client
```

## Documentation

The full library documentation can be [found here](https://jonnybergdahl.github.io/growcube-client/).

## Getting started

The `src/growcube_sample.py` file shows how to use the library. It defines a callback function where the GrowcubeClient
sends messages as they arrive from the Growcube device. To use the sample, change the `HOST` variable to the host
name or IP address of the Growcube device. Then run the sample with:

```bash
python3 growcube_sample.py
```

Source code:

```python
import asyncio
from growcube_client import GrowcubeReport, GrowcubeClient


# Define a on_message_callback function to print messages to the screen
def callback(report: GrowcubeReport) -> None:
    # Just dump the message to the console
    print(f"Received: {report.get_description()}")


async def main(host: str) -> None:
    # Create a client instance
    client = GrowcubeClient(host, callback)
    print(f"Connecting to Growcube at {HOST}")

    # Connect to the Growcube and start listening for messages
    await client.connect()

    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set host name or IP address
    HOST = "172.30.2.72"

    asyncio.run(main(HOST))
```

Sample script output.

## More advanced use

The `src/growcube_app.py` file shows how to use the library in a more advanced application. 

To use the app, you need to install `wxPython` first, please follow [the directions here](https://wiki.wxpython.org/How%20to%20install%20wxPython).

Start the app with:
```bash
python3 growcube_app.py
```

You are greeted with a screen asking for the host name or IP address of the Growcube device. 
Enter that and click the _Submit_ button. The app will connect to your Growcube and starts
displaying received data.

You can water plants by setting a watering duration and clicking the _Pump X_ button.

## Adopt Growcube device

The `src/growcube_adopt.py` file can be used to set WiFi credentials of a new or factory reset Growcube device, 
without the need for the Growcube phone app. 

  1. Make sure the Growcube flashes it's red and blue LED's. 
  2. Connect to the Growcube_Xxxx WiFi, password is 88888888
  3. Run the `growcube_adopt.py` file
  4. Press the _Connect_ button and wait for connection
  5. Enter the WiFi credentials and press the _Save_ button
  6. Wait for the device to connect to WiFi
  7. Take a note of the IP address or MAC address as needed

Your Growcube is now connected to your WiFi.

# Auto discovery

You can use the sample script `src/growcube_discover.py` to search for devices on your network. By default, it will
search for devices on the local network, but if the devices are located in a separate subnet you can also specify 
that network to search in. 

```bash
python3 growcube_discover.py 192.168.4.0/24
```

The output will look like this.

```
