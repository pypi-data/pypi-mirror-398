**MadMax** is a reverse-engineered Python library for interacting with the Russian national messenger **MAX** (backend: `oneme.ru`).  
It allows you to receive messages and events via WebSocket without using a browser.

---

## 📦 Installation

Since you are cool enough to use the command line:

```bash
pip install madmax
```

## 🚀 Quick Start
```python
import asyncio
from madmax import Client

# See "How to get credentials" below
TOKEN = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
DEVICE_ID = "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"

client = Client(token=TOKEN, device_id=DEVICE_ID)

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    print(f"[{message.sender_id}] says: {message.text}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    client.run()
```

## 🔑 How to get credentials
Since MAX does not have an open API, you need to borrow your own session credentials from the browser.

1. Open web.max.ru in Chrome/Edge.
2. Log in to your account.
3. Open Developer Tools (**F12**).
4. Go to **Application** tab -> **Local Storage** -> https://web.max.ru.
5. Find and copy values for:
- `__oneme_auth` -> This is your **TOKEN**.
- `__oneme_device_id` -> This is your **DEVICE_ID**.

**Warning**: Do not share your token with anyone. It gives full access to your account.
