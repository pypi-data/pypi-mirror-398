First register your company with the Odoo S.A. access point, following instructions from the
[official Odoo documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/applications/finance/accounting/customer_invoices/electronic_invoicing.html?highlight=peppol#peppol).

When the registration is active, the Vendor Bills and Refunds will flow in.

To send invoices, configure the Peppol settings on each customer form, and use
the regular Send & Print wizard and check the Send via PEPPOL option which will
be visible if the partner is correctly configured.
