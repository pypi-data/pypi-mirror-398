This is a backport of the ``account_peppol`` addon of Odoo 17:

-  the registration/unregistration logic and UI;
-  the logic to determine if a partner is registered on the Peppol
   network and the supported formats;
-  the cron to receive documents and create Vendor Bills;
-  a Send via Peppol option and button in the invoice Send & Print
   wizard;
-  a method to send a invoice to the access point (the actual sending
   logic is provided by other modules, see the Installation section);
-  the cron to update the status of Peppol document sent to the network.

There are a few differences from the Odoo 17 module:

-  Only the the ``ubl_bis3`` format is supported for now.
-  Sending is done either synchronously or asynchronously via queue job
   (one job per invoice), where in Odoo 17 sending is done
   asynchrounously in a cron job with multiple invoices sent in one API
   call.
-  The flag ``is_move_sent`` is set when the Peppol status of an Invoice
   is set to ``done`` by the batch that updates the statuses. The
   upstream module does not handle the ``is_move_sent`` flag.
-  It can log the sent XML file in the chatter when a
   ``account_peppol_backport.log_sent_xml`` system parameter is set to a
   non empty value.

Note that when doing the registration with this module, the company is
registered as a participant, so a receiver. In v18, it is possible to
register as a sender only.

Usage
=====

First register your company with the Odoo S.A. access point, following
instructions from the `official Odoo
documentation <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/applications/finance/accounting/customer_invoices/electronic_invoicing.html?highlight=peppol#peppol>`__.

When the registration is active, the Vendor Bills and Refunds will flow
in.

To send invoices, configure the Peppol settings on each customer form,
and use the regular Send & Print wizard and check the Send via PEPPOL
option which will be visible if the partner is correctly configured.
