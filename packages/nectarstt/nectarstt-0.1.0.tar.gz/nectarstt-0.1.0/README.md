# 🍯 NectarSTT  
**Nectar Speech-to-Text Engine**

NectarSTT (Nectar Speech To Text) is a Python-based speech recognition engine designed for real-time, offline-capable voice input. It is built to be modular, extensible, and suitable for AI assistants, automation systems, and accessibility tools.

This project focuses on **accurate speech recognition**, **low latency**, and **tight integration with AI pipelines**.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/headlessripper/NectarSTT.git
cd NectarSTT
```
---

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate 

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


---

## 📦 Models & Assets

Due to GitHub size limits, speech models and voice data are zipped into **Main-Engine.zip**.  
This archive contains:

- `Main-Engine/Model/`
- `Main-Engine/TTS-Engine/`

Extract `Main-Engine.zip` into the project directory before running NectarSTT.

> 💡 A setup script or model downloader may be added in future releases.

---

### ▶️ Usage

Example (basic run):

- `python main.py`

Or import as a module:

- `from nectar_stt import recognize_speech`
```
text = recognize_speech()
print(text)
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure:

- 🎤 Microphone device
- ⏱️ Timeout values
- 🌐 Language
- 🧠 Model selection

These settings can be adjusted in the engine UI or directly in the code, depending on your integration needs.

## 🚀 Roadmap / Ideas

- Automated model download & setup script
- Extended TTS engine support
- Additional language models
- Optional Futher GPU acceleration (where supported)
- Enhanced logging and debugging tools
