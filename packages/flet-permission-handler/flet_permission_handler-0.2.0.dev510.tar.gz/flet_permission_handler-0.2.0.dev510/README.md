A [Flet](https://flet.dev) extension that simplifies working with device permissions.

It is based on the [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) Flutter package
and brings similar functionality to Flet, including:

- Requesting permissions at runtime
- Checking the current permission status (e.g., granted, denied)
- Redirecting users to system settings to manually grant permissions
