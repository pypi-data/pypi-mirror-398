  The agent should call this tool to signal that the overall task is starting.
  This is important as there are other entities that want to know that the agent
  is starting to execute an overall task.
  For example, an experiment controller may send an overall task to the agent to
  execute and wants confirmation that the agent indeed started working on the
  task.
  """

_DONE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
  The agent should call this tool to signal that the overall task is done.
  This is important as there are other entities that are waiting for the
  overall task to be done. For example, an experiment controller may be waiting
  for the agent to signal that the overall task is done before running the next
  experiment with a new overall (often long-horizon) task.
