# Knowledgenet
Knowledgenet is a Python Language software library that enables application developers to build applications that make complex decisions based on **facts** supplied to the service entrypoint and **rules** developed by **application developers** and **business users**. Knowledgenet is an implementation of an **Inference Engine** using an adaptation of the Rete algorithm designed by **Charles L. Forgy** of Carnegie Melon University. Rete is an efficient pattern matching algorithm that is widely used in many AI systems including Expert Systems.
