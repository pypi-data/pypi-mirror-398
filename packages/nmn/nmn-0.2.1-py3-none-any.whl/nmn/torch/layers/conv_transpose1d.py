        r"""Applies a 1D transposed convolution operator over an input image
    composed of several input planes.

    This module can be seen as the gradient of Conv1d with respect to its input.
    It is also known as a fractionally-strided convolution or
    a deconvolution (although it is not an actual deconvolution operation as it does
    not compute a true inverse of convolution). For more information, see the visualizations
    `here`_ and the `Deconvolutional Networks`_ paper.

    This module supports :ref:`TensorFloat32<tf32_on_ampere>`.

    On certain ROCm devices, when using float16 inputs this module will use :ref:`different precision<fp16_on_mi200>` for backward.

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero padding on both
      sides for ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding`` number of points. See note
      below for details.

    * :attr:`output_padding` controls the additional size added to one side
      of the output shape. See note below for details.
"""
        """
    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the \u00e0 trous algorithm.
      It is harder to describe, but the link `here`_ has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.
"""
        r"""
    {groups_note}

    Note:
        The :attr:`padding` argument effectively adds ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding``
        amount of zero padding to both sizes of the input. This is set so that
        when a :class:`~torch.nn.Conv1d` and a :class:`~torch.nn.ConvTranspose1d`
        are initialized with same parameters, they are inverses of each other in
        regard to the input and output shapes. However, when ``stride > 1``,
        :class:`~torch.nn.Conv1d` maps multiple input shapes to the same output
        shape. :attr:`output_padding` is provided to resolve this ambiguity by
        effectively increasing the calculated output shape on one side. Note
        that :attr:`output_padding` is only used to find output shape, but does
        not actually add zero-padding to output.

    Note:
        In some circumstances when using the CUDA backend with CuDNN, this operator
        may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is
        undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at
        a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic =
        True``.
        Please see the notes on :doc:`/notes/randomness` for background.
