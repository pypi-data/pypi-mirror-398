## 🐛 **v2.0.7 - Bug Fix Release: Sample Values & Query Timeout**

> **Bug Fix Release** 🛠️

**Release Date**: October 13, 2025
**Author**: Arjun Trivedi
**Email**: arjuntrivedi42@yahoo.com
**Repository**: https://github.com/4R9UN/mcp-kql-server

### 🚀 **What's Fixed in v2.0.7**

This release addresses critical bugs in the schema discovery system that were preventing sample values from being populated and causing query timeout issues.

#### **1. Sample Values Bug Fix**
- **🔧 Fixed Empty Sample Values**: Resolved issue where `sample_values` field was returning empty arrays in schema discovery
- **📊 Data Population**: All three schema discovery strategies now properly execute `| take 2` queries to fetch actual sample data
- **✅ Consistent Behavior**: Strategy 1 (JSON Schema) and Strategy 2 (getschema) now match Strategy 3's working implementation
- **🎯 Real Data Examples**: AI-enhanced column descriptions now have access to actual table data for better context

#### **2. Query Timeout Improvements**
- **⚡ Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved handling of query timeout scenarios
- **🛠️ Better Error Messages**: More informative error messages when queries time out
- **📝 Logging Enhancements**: Better debugging information for timeout-related issues

### 🔧 **Technical Changes**

#### **Schema Discovery Enhancement ([`utils.py`](mcp_kql_server/utils.py))**

**Strategy 1 - JSON Schema Discovery (Lines 1841-1867)**:
- Added sample data query execution after schema discovery
- Extracts sample values for each column from `| take 2` results
- Populates `sample_values` with actual table data
- Includes error handling for sample data retrieval failures

**Strategy 2 - getschema Discovery (Lines 1871-1913)**:
- Added sample data query execution after getschema
- Extracts sample values for each column from `| take 2` results
- Populates `sample_values` with actual table data
- Includes error handling for sample data retrieval failures

**Key Implementation Pattern**:
```python
# Get sample data for all columns
sample_data = {}
try:
    bracketed_table = bracket_if_needed(table)
    sample_query = f"{bracketed_table} | take 2"
    sample_result = await self._execute_kusto_async(sample_query, cluster, database, is_mgmt=False)
    
    if sample_result and len(sample_result) > 0:
        # Extract sample values for each column
        sample_values = [str(row.get(col_name, '')) for row in sample_result[:2]
                        if row.get(col_name) is not None]
        sample_data[col_name] = sample_values
except Exception as sample_error:
    logger.debug(f"Failed to get sample data: {sample_error}")
```

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

#### **Critical Fixes**
- **Sample Values Population**: Fixed bug where Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 weren't fetching actual sample data from tables
- **Query Execution**: Ensured `| take 2` queries execute properly to populate sample values
- **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for sample data retrieval to prevent schema discovery failures
- **Consistency**: All three schema discovery strategies now behave identically regarding sample values

#### **Impact**

- **Query Generation**: Improved natural language to KQL query generation with real data context
- **Schema Intelligence**: Enhanced schema descriptions with actual value examples

### 📦 **Installation & Upgrade**

#### **New Installation**
```bash
pip install mcp-kql-server==2.0.7
```

## 🚀 **v2.0.6 - Architectural Refactoring & Intelligence Upgrade**

> **Major Refactor Release**  архитектура

**Release Date**: September 9, 2025
**Author**: Arjun Trivedi
**Email**: arjuntrivedi42@yahoo.com
**Repository**: https://github.com/4R9UN/mcp-kql-server

### 🚀 **What's New in v2.0.6**

This release marks a significant architectural evolution of the MCP KQL Server, focusing on maintainability, robustness, and enhanced intelligence. The entire codebase has been refactored to introduce a centralized processing pipeline and dynamic, context-aware schema analysis.

#### **1. Centralized Processing Pipeline (`utils.py`)**
- **✅ `QueryProcessor` Class**: A dedicated class now handles all query pre-processing, including cleaning, validation, and parsing of cluster/database information. This standardizes input handling.
- **✅ `ErrorHandler` Class**: A robust, centralized error handler that classifies Kusto exceptions and provides structured, actionable error messages. This dramatically improves the user experience when queries fail.
- **✅ `SchemaManager` Class**: A utility helper for managing and formatting schema information consistently.

#### **2. Dynamic Schema Intelligence (`constants.py`)**
- **🧠 `DynamicSchemaAnalyzer`**: Moves beyond static keywords to intelligently analyze table names and properties, generating richer, more accurate AI-friendly descriptions.
- **🧠 `DynamicColumnAnalyzer`**: Analyzes column names and data types to infer semantics, use cases, and relationships, providing deeper context to the AI model.

#### **3. Asynchronous Post-Query Learning (`execute_kql.py`)**
- **⚡ Async Learning**: After a successful query, a non-blocking background task (`post_query_learning`) is now spawned to update the unified memory. This ensures the server remains responsive while continuously learning.

#### **4. Codebase Refactoring & Clarity**
- **🧹 Separation of Concerns**: Each module now has a more clearly defined responsibility, from authentication (`kql_auth.py`) to memory (`memory.py`) to execution (`execute_kql.py`).
- **📝 Updated Documentation**: The `docs/architecture.md` file has been completely rewritten to reflect the new, more sophisticated architecture.
- **👤 Author Validation**: Ensured all core files contain up-to-date author and contact information.

### 🔧 **Technical Changes**

- **Refactored `mcp_server.py`**: The main server file now orchestrates calls to the new utility classes in `utils.py`, simplifying its logic.
- **Introduced `utils.py`**: This new module contains the core business logic, abstracting it away from the MCP tool definitions.
- **Enhanced `constants.py`**: Expanded from a simple constants file to an intelligence hub containing the dynamic analyzer classes.
- **Modified `execute_kql.py`**: Updated to use the new `ErrorHandler` and to trigger the asynchronous learning task.
- **Updated `memory.py`**: The `MemoryManager` now leverages the dynamic analyzers from `constants.py` to enrich schemas.

### 🎯 **Benefits**
- **Maintainability**: The new architecture is significantly easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
- **Robustness**: Centralized error handling provides more consistent and helpful feedback.
- **Intelligence**: Dynamic schema analysis delivers far superior context to the AI, enabling more accurate and powerful query generation.
- **Performance**: Asynchronous learning ensures the server's core functionality is not blocked by background tasks.

### 📦 **Installation & Upgrade**

#### **New Installation**
```bash
pip install mcp-kql-server==2.0.6
```

#### **Upgrade from Previous Versions**
```bash
pip install --upgrade mcp-kql-server
```

### ✅ **Quality Assurance**
- **Full Test Suite**: All existing tests were updated and are passing, ensuring backward compatibility of features.
- **Architectural Review**: The new architecture has been documented and reviewed for clarity and correctness.
- **End-to-End Validation**: Confirmed that the entire query pipeline—from processing to execution to learning—functions as expected.

## 🛠️ **Migration Guide**

### **Schema Cache Migration**
The new unified memory system will automatically migrate existing cache files. No manual intervention required.

### **Configuration Migration**
```bash
# Old v1.x environment variables (no longer required)
# export KQL_MEMORY_PATH="/path/to/memory"
# export AZURE_CORE_ONLY_SHOW_ERRORS=true

# New v2.0.0 (optional)
export KQL_DEBUG=true  # Only for debugging
```

### **API Usage Updates**
Query and schema memory APIs remain backward compatible. New features available through optional parameters.
