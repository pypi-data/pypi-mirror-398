# Experiments

This directory contains experimental code, prototypes, and research scripts that are not part of the main production codebase.

## Structure

- Use subdirectories for specific experiments (e.g., `experiments/tfjs-prototype`)
- Add a README in each subdirectory explaining the experiment's goal.
