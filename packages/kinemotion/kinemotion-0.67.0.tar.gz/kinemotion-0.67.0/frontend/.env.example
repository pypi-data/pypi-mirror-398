# API Backend URL
# Leave unset or empty for development (uses Vite proxy to localhost:8000)
# Set to your deployed backend URL in Vercel for production

# Development (local):
# No environment variable needed - uses Vite proxy configured in vite.config.ts

# Production (Fly.io):
# Set this in Vercel Dashboard: Settings → Environment Variables
# VITE_API_URL=https://kinemotion-api.fly.dev

# Note: Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with VITE_
# These variables are replaced at build time, not runtime
