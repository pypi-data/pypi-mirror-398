# MVP Feedback Collection Plan

**Reference:** `docs/strategy/MVP_FEEDBACK_COLLECTION.md` (full detailed version)

**Timeline:** Week 4-5
**Target:** 5-10 coaches

---

## Coach Recruitment

**Target Profile:**
- Jump sport background (CrossFit, track & field, basketball)

- Willing to spend 15 minutes testing

**Where to Find:**
- LinkedIn search: "CrossFit coach", "track & field coach"

## 5 Key Questions

1. **Accuracy Trust**
   - "Do the metrics seem accurate for your athletes?"

2. **Current Workflow**
   - "How do you currently analyze jump videos?"

3. **Feature Priority** (CRITICAL)
   - Rate: Real-time vs Running vs API vs UI improvements

4. **Willingness to Pay**
   - Free only? $50/mo? $100-200/mo? $500+/mo?

5. **Open Feedback**
   - "What else should we build?"
