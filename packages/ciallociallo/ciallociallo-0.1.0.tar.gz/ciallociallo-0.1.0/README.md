# ciallociallo

Say Ciallo~(∠・ω< )⌒★ in your terminal! 

This is a CLI ASCII animation screensaver. Simply Run `ciallociallo`, and you should see Ririko smiling on your screen.

### How to install

You need `pip` to install `ciallociallo`. 

```bash
pip install ciallociallo
```

### Characters

You can use `ciallociallo murasame` to specify the character. The default character is Ririko. 

Use `ciallociallo -h` to see all characters.

### Too long?

You can use `alias` to make it shorter, for example

Bash (~/.bashrc):
```bash
echo "alias ciallo='ciallociallo'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Zsh(~/.zshrc):
```bash
echo "alias ciallo='ciallociallo'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

...or modify $PROFILE in PowerShell. After that, you can simply type `ciallo amane`.

### Ririko is here!
