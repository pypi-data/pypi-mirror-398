              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This repository provides `Google Earth Engine <https://earthengine.google.com/>`__ Python API based implementation of the ASCE Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration Equations (ASCE2005_) for computing daily and hourly reference ET.

Usage
=====

Daily
-----

The following demonstrates how to compute a single daily ETr value using weather data for 2015-07-01 from the `Fallon, NV AgriMet station <https://www.usbr.gov/pn/agrimet/agrimetmap/falnda.html>`__.
The necessary unit conversions are shown on the input values.
The raw input data is available `here <https://www.usbr.gov/pn-bin/daily.pl?station=FALN&year=2015&month=7&day=1&year=2015&month=7&day=1&pcode=ETRS&pcode=MN&pcode=MX&pcode=SR&pcode=YM&pcode=UA>`__.

ERA5-Land
---------

Helper functions for computing daily/hourly ETo/ETr for `ERA5-Land <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land>`__ images are available.

For the daily function, the ERA5-Land collection must be filtered to a single 24 hour period.

.. code-block:: console

    import ee
    import openet.refetgee

    source_coll = ee.ImageCollection('ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/HOURLY')\
        .filterDate('2015-07-01', '2015-07-02')
    etr = (
        openet.refetgee.Daily.era5_land(source_coll).etr
        .reduceRegion(reducer=ee.Reducer.first(),
                      geometry=ee.Geometry.Point(-118.77388, 39.4575),
                      scale=1000)
        .getInfo()
    )

    print('ETr: {:.2f} mm'.format(float(etr['etr'])))

.. code-block:: console

    import ee
    import openet.refetgee

    source_img = ee.Image('ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/HOURLY/20150701T20')
    etr = (
        openet.refetgee.Hourly.era5_land(source_img).etr
        .reduceRegion(reducer=ee.Reducer.first(),
                      geometry=ee.Geometry.Point(-118.77388, 39.4575),
                      scale=1000)
        .getInfo()
    )

    print('ETr: {:.2f} mm'.format(float(etr['etr'])))

Issues
======

Currently the user must handle all of the file I/O and unit conversions.

Cloudiness Fraction (hourly)
----------------------------

The cloudiness fraction (fcd) is computed as the ratio of the measured solar radiation (Rs) to the theoretical clear sky solar radiation (Rso).  This ratio cannot be computed directly at night since Rso is 0.  ASCE-EWRI 2005 suggests computing a representative nighttime fcd based on the fcd at sunset and/or sunrise.

In the RefET module fcd is hard coded to 1 for all time steps with very low sun angles since the hourly reference ET is computed independently for each time step.

Calculation Method - ASCE vs. RefET
===================================

The main difference between the two "methods" is that the "asce" method attempts to follow the equations in ASCE2005_, whereas the "refet" method attempts to follow the calculations of the `RefET Software <https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/kimberly-research-and-extension-center/research/water-resources/ref-et-software>`__ as closely as possible.  The difference in output between these methods is generally negligible (if not identical for realistic numbers of significant digits).  Note that the default is set to "asce" to best match the calculations a user would expect to have happen. The "refet" method was added in order to help validate this code to the RefET Software.

Installation
============

The OpenET RefET GEE python module can be installed via pip:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install openet-refet-gee

OpenET Namespace Package
========================

Each OpenET model is stored in the "openet" folder (namespace).  The model can then be imported as a "dot" submodule of the main openet module.

.. code-block:: console

    import openet.refetgee as refetgee

Validation
==========

Please see the `validation document <VALIDATION.md>`__ for additional details on the source of the test values and the comparison of the functions to the Ref-ET software.

Dependencies
============

 * `earthengine-api <https://github.com/google/earthengine-api>`__

Modules needed to run the test suite:

 * `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`__
 * `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__
 * `pytz <http://pythonhosted.org/pytz/>`__
