        # Trusted publishing is used automatically if configured in PyPI.
        # To set up trusted publishing:
        # 1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
        # 2. Add a new pending publisher with:
        #    - PyPI project name: livy-uploads
        #    - Owner: your-github-username
        #    - Repository name: livy-uploads
        #    - Workflow filename: .github/workflows/publish.yml
        # 3. After creating the publisher, approve it in your PyPI account settings
        #
        # Alternative: If you prefer using an API token:
        # env:
        #   TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
        #   TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
