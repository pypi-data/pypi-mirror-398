# EdgeFirst Validator

This repository contains the Packer configuration, entrypoint script, and the validation implementation used by EdgeFirst Studio to perform validation of Vision (detection, segmentation, multitask) models with support for Keras, ONNX, TensorRT, and TFLite either on the cloud or on target validation.

## Changelog
- Nov 26, 2025 [v5.0.0]: Merge Ultralytics and Deployment (EdgeFirst) metrics. Computation of deployment metrics @ optimal thresholds. Defined validation stages.
- Nov 14, 2025 [v4.2.0]: Added HAL support (TBR). Added Kinara model support. Distinguish semantic and instance segmentation metrics. 
- Aug 24, 2025 [v4.1.0]: Added ModelPack external decoding. Added Keras support. Added TP vs FP scores chart. Removed +1 padding to the NumPy NMS. 
- June 16, 2025 [v4.0.0]: EdgeFirst Validator (formerly Deep View Validator) - Ultralytics metrics and EdgeFirst Studio integrations.

## Installation

For on target validation, the system may already contain the dependencies needed to run the model such as `tflite_runtime` for TensorFlow Lite. In such cases, it is recommended to first [create a python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) with the `--system-site-packages` option enabled.

EdgeFirst-Validator is available in PyPI and can be installed via pip.

```shell
pip install edgefirst-validator
```

Validation of specific models requires these installations which includes the packages needed to run the models, in case the system at present does not contain these packages.

* Keras `pip install edgefirst-validator[keras]`
* ONNX: `pip install edgefirst-validator[onnx]`
* TensorRT: `pip install edgefirst-validator[tensorrt]`
* TFLite: `pip install edgefirst-validator[tflite]`


## Usage

1. As a quickstart, deploy default validation of a YOLOv5 model with COCO128 dataset.

    ```shell
    edgefirst-validator
    ```

2. Deploy validation as a user-managed session in EdgeFirst Studio. First login with EdgeFirst Client.

    ```shell
    edgefirst-client login
    ```

    ```shell
    edgefirst-validator --session-id <validator session ID>
    ```

    Otherwise, you can specify the credentials directly.

    ```shell
    edgefirst-validator --token <token> --session-id <validator session ID>
    ```

    ```shell
    edgefirst-validator --username <username> --password <password> --session-id <Validator Session ID>
    ```

3. Deploy standalone validation.

    ```shell
    edgefirst-validator <model path> <dataset path>
    ```
