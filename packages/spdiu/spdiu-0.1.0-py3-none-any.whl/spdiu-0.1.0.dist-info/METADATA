> SpdIU is a collection of [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) tasks that manage [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/) game data.

It's a library of tricks to make your SPD CLI experience as comfortable as the rest of your awesome terminal!

- Run common tasks out of the box from your console
- Hook up your own Python tasks, leveraging the `spdiu` library

# What does it do?

## Save and Load the game

SpdIU keeps a directory of save slots, containing copies of the game's full data folder.

- `siu save` and `load` are all the commands you need to save-scum your way to 9-challenge
- Safety backups give you a chance to un-wreck your save if you fat-finger it


## Check for updates or download older versions

On github releases, just pick your version.

Create an issue if you know of an SPD fork hosted elsewhere, and we'll try to enable that platform, too!


## Install flavors and remixes

With just a bit of configuration, you can use SpdIU to download any of the SPD forks available in the wild!


## Display Profile and Game data

Get overviews of every single thing stored in your save data.


## Cheat like it's 1989

Βless your next run with one out of a selection of care packages, or downright edit in that upgraded armor you wanted.

It's your game, after all!
