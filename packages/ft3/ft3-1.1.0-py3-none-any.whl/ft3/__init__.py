Overview
========

**Author:** dan@1howardcapital.com

**Summary:** Zero-dependency python framework for object oriented development.
Implement _once_, document _once_, in _one_ place.

---

With ft3, you will quickly learn established best practice... \
or face the consequences of runtime errors that will break your code \
if you deviate from it.

Experienced python engineers will find a framework \
that expects and rewards intuitive magic method implementations, \
consistent type annotations, and robust docstrings.

Implement _pythonically_ with ft3 and you will only ever need to: \
implement _once_, document _once_, in _one_ place.
