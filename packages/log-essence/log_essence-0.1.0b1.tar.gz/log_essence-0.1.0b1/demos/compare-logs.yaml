    narration: "Look at these production logs. They contain emails, credit card numbers, API keys, and stack traces. Pasting this directly into Claude is a security risk."

    narration: "All emails, credit cards, API keys, and other secrets are replaced with correlation-preserving hashes. The same email always gets the same hash, so you can still trace user journeys."

    narration: "Repetitive log messages are grouped into semantic clusters. Instead of seeing the same pattern fifty times, you see it once with a count."

    narration: "The result? Eighty-nine percent fewer tokens, zero exposed secrets, and actionable insights Claude can actually use."
