# End Of File Fixer

A command-line tool that ensures all your text files end with exactly one newline character.
This tool helps maintain consistent file formatting across your codebase by automatically adding or removing trailing newlines as needed.

## Why This Matters

Many POSIX systems expect text files to end with a newline character. Having consistent line endings:
- Prevents spurious diffs in version control
- Ensures proper concatenation of files
- Satisfies POSIX compliance
- Improves readability in terminal environments

## Features

- Automatically adds a newline to files that don't end with one
- Removes excess trailing newlines from files that have too many
- Respects `.gitignore` patterns to avoid processing unwanted files
- Works with all text file types
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Dry-run mode to preview changes before applying them

## Installation

### Using uv

```bash
uv add eof-fixer
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install eof-fixer
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To fix all files in the current directory and subdirectories:

```bash
eof-fixer .
```

To check which files would be modified without making changes:

```bash
eof-fixer . --check
```

## How It Works

The eof-fixer processes files in the following way:

1. **Files with no trailing newline**: Adds exactly one newline at the end
2. **Files with exactly one trailing newline**: Leaves unchanged
3. **Files with multiple trailing newlines**: Truncates to exactly one newline
4. **Empty files**: Left unchanged

### Examples

| Original File Content | After Processing |
|----------------------|------------------|
| `hello world`        | `hello world\n`  |
| `hello world\n`      | `hello world\n`  |
| `hello world\n\n\n`  | `hello world\n`  |
| `` (empty file)      | `` (unchanged)   |

## Configuration

The tool automatically respects patterns in your `.gitignore` file, so it won't process files that are ignored by Git. Additionally, it always ignores:
- `.git` directories
- `.cache` directories (used by uv)

## Exit Codes

- `0`: No files needed fixing or all files were successfully fixed
- `1`: Some files needed fixing (when using `--check` mode)
