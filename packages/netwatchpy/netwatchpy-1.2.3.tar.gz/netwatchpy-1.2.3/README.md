## Features

* **Real-time Dashboard:** A clean, terminal-based dashboard showing total download, upload, and current speeds.
* **Historical Analytics:** View your usage trends for the last 24 hours with hourly breakdown, peak hour identification, and traffic statistics including download/upload percentages and average usage.
* **Crash-Proof Database:** Powered by SQLite with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) to ensure your data is safe even if your PC loses power.
* **Data Cap Monitoring:** Set a data limit (e.g., `10GB`) and see your usage on a real-time progress bar.
* **Desktop Notifications:** Get native desktop notifications when you hit 80% and 100% of your data limit.
* **Live Activity Log:** An interactive, scrolling log of all network activity, updated every second.
* **Command Palette & Dark Mode:** A modern TUI experience with a built-in command palette (`Ctrl+P`) and dark mode support (`Ctrl+D`).
* **Auto-Migration:** Automatically detects and imports data from older versions (`quota.json`) so you never lose history.
* **Cross-Platform:** Runs perfectly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Understanding the Interface

#### 1\. Live Monitor Tab

This is the default view. It shows:

*   **Summary Cards:** Total Upload, Download, and Combined Usage for the current session + history.
    
*   **Quota Bar:** If a limit was set, this bar fills up. It turns **Yellow at 80%** and **Red at 100%**.
    
*   **Live Table:** A scrolling list of network speeds recorded every second.
    

#### 2\. History Tab (24h)

This tab visualizes your traffic over the last 24 hours.

*   **Rows:** Each row represents a 1-hour block of time (e.g., 14:00 covers 2:00 PM to 2:59 PM).
    
*   **The Bar:**
    
    *   **Solid Block (█):** Represents Download traffic.
        
    *   **Shaded Block (░):** Represents Upload traffic.
        
*   **Total:** The text on the right shows the exact data transferred during that hour.
    

> **Tip:** If the graph looks outdated, press r to pull the latest stats from the database.
