# ModelWrapper

`ModelWrapper` provides a unified interface for interacting with different Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks and libraries. It abstracts away the complexities of structured generation, batching, and async execution, allowing tasks to work seamlessly with various backends like DSPy, Outlines, or LangChain.
