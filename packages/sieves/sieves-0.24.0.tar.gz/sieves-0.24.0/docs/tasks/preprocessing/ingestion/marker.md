# Marker

[Marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker) is a tool for converting PDF documents to text.

Note: This task depends on optional ingestion libraries that are not installed by default. You can install them via the ingestion extra, or install the library directly.

Examples:

```bash
pip install "sieves[ingestion]"   # installs ingestion deps via extra
# or install the library directly (e.g., the Marker PDF package)
pip install marker                 # or the appropriate marker package variant
```
