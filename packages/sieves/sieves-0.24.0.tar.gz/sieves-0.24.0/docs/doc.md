# Doc

The `Doc` class is the fundamental unit of data in `sieves`. It encapsulates the text to be processed, its associated metadata, and the results generated by various tasks in a pipeline.

## Usage

```python
--8<-- "sieves/tests/docs/test_doc_usage.py:doc-usage"
```

## Metadata and Observability

The `meta` field stores detailed execution traces, including raw model outputs and token usage statistics. This is particularly useful for debugging and cost monitoring. For a deep dive into how to use these features, see the [Observability and Usage Tracking guide](guides/observability.md).
