.SH "NAME"
dotbackup \- YAML config based backup utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBdotbackup\fP [\-h|\-\-help] [\-c|\-\-config \fICONFIG\fP] [\-l|\-\-list] [\-v|\-\-version]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Usually people maintain backup and setup scripts along with their dotfiles. But
these scripts always contain a lot of repeat codes, and writing them is not fun!
dotbackup and dotsetup are here to help.
.sp
With these two tools, you only need to write a simple configuration and they
will know how to back up and set up your dotfiles. See the \fICONFIGURATION\fP
section for the configuration definition.
.sp
When you invoke dotbackup, it copies each application\(cqs \fIfiles\fP to the
\fIbackup_dir\fP (if no \fIapp\fP provided, all application\(cqs \fIfiles\fP will be copied).
And dotsetup does the opposite. Backup file\(cqs relative path to the \fIbackup_dir\fP
is the same as the original file\(cqs relative path to the home directory, so
dotsetup knows how to copy them back.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.RE

Configuration files under \fI~/.config/dotbackup\fP can also be specified by their
basenames, e.g., \fI~/.config/dotbackup/config.yml\fP can be specified by
\fIconfig\fP. See \fICONFIGURATION\fP section for configuration definition.

definitions.
.sp
\fIbackup_dir\fP
.RS 4
A string. The directory where backup files are stored.
.RE
.sp
\fIclean\fP

A boolean. Whether to delete files in destination path before backup and
setup. The default is \f(CRfalse\fP. Option \fB\-\-clean\fP override this configuration.
.RE
.sp
\fIignore\fP
.RS 4
A list of glob strings. The global ignored file patterns. Files that matches
one of these patterns will be ignored. But files that are directly specified
in \fIapps.<app>.files\fP are not ignored.
.RE
.sp
\fIapps.<app>.files\fP
.RS 4
A list of path strings. The files to be backed up of the application \fI<app>\fP,
\fI<app>\fP can be any string. File paths \fBMUST\fP be relative to the home directory
due to implementation. You can use \fIHOOKS\fP to manipulate other files.
.RE
.sp
\fIapps.<app>.ignore\fP
.RS 4
A list of glob strings. The application level ignored file patterns. Files
that matches one of these patterns will be ignored when back up and set up
\fI<app>\fP. But files that are directly specified in \fIapps.<app>.files\fP are not
ignored.
.RE
.sp
\fIapps.<app>.<pre_backup|post_backup|pre_setup|post_setup>\fP
.RS 4
A list of script strings. The application level custom hooks, \fI<app>\fP can be
any string. See \fIHOOKS\fP and \fIEXAMPLES\fP for details.
.RE
.sp
\fI<pre_backup|post_backup|pre_setup|post_setup>\fP
.RS 4
A list of script strings. The global custom hooks. See \fIHOOKS\fP and \fIEXAMPLES\fP
for details.
.RE
.SH "HOOKS"
.sp
Technically, hooks are just shell scripts to be executed by \f(CRsh \-s\fP. They can be
divide into backup hooks and setup hooks. The execution order is indicated by
their names. For example, the execution order of backup hooks may be like this:
.sp
pre_backup
.br
apps.app1.pre_backup
.br
copy \fIapps.app1.files\fP
.br
apps.app1.post_backup
.br
apps.app2.pre_backup
.br
copy \fIapps.app2.files\fP
.br
apps.app2.post_backup
.br
post_backup
.sp
And in hooks, you can use the environment variable \fIBACKUP_DIR\fP which is set to
\fIbackup_dir\fP. So you can use hooks to things beyond copying \fIfiles\fP, e.g., file
post\-processing.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
First of all, dotbackup can back up itself:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
backup_dir: ~/backup
apps:
  dotbackup:
    files: [~/.config/dotbackup/dotbackup.yml]
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
A configuration back up Vim and Neovim:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
backup_dir: ~/backup
apps:
  vim:
    files: [~/.vimrc]
  nvim:
    files:
      \- ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
      \- ~/.config/nvim/lua
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
A configuration which use hooks to generate timestamp and make Git commit:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
backup_dir: ~/backup
apps:
  vim:
    files: [~/.vimrc]
  nvim:
    files:
      \- ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
      \- ~/.config/nvim/lua
post_backup:
  \- date > "$BACKUP_DIR/timestamp"
  \- |
    set \-e
    cd $BACKUP_DIR
    git commit \-am "backup of $(date)"
    git push
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp

.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
