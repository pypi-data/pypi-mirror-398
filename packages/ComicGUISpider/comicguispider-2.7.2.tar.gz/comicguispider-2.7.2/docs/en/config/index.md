### Mapping / `custom_map`

Search input mapping  
When the search does not meet the preset, first add the key-value pair here, and after restarting, the corresponding website results will be output when entering the custom key in the search box

1. Mapping does not need to care about the domain name, as long as it is used in the current website, as long as it meets `can access without mapping` and `the entered is not an invalid url`, the program will automatically replace it with a usable domain name, such as `wnacg.com` will be automatically replaced with the default domain name under non-proxy mapping
2. Note that the custom mapping may exceed the range of the paging rule, and at this time, it can be notified to the developer for expansion

### Preset / `completer`

Custom preset  
There will be a `number corresponding to the website` prompt when the mouse hovers over the input box (in fact, it is the number of the choose-box)
