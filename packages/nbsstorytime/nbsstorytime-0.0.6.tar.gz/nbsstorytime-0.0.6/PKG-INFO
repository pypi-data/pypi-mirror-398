## How to use

Example of a cell with N4L code - use a cell of type **raw** which
starts by the line:

        #| n4l

        - my notes  # you give it a title
                    # and you can leave comments to yourself.

        Mostly you just write notes
            "  (e.g.)  This is a simple example that illustrates the line above
