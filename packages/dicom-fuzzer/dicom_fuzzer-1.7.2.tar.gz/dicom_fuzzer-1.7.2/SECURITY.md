| < 1.6   | No            |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

**DO** use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Dashtid/dicom-fuzzer/security/advisories/new).

Include: description, reproduction steps, affected versions, impact, PoC if available.

| Severity | Response | Fix Timeline |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| CRITICAL | 24 hours | 7 days       |
| HIGH     | 48 hours | 14 days      |
| MEDIUM   | 7 days   | 30 days      |
| LOW      | 14 days  | 60 days      |

## Authorized Use

DICOM Fuzzer is for **authorized security testing only**.

1. Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
2. Comply with applicable laws (CFAA, GDPR, HIPAA)
3. Report discovered vulnerabilities responsibly
4. Use for defensive security, not malicious purposes

## Protected Health Information (PHI)

DICOM files often contain PHI. Follow these requirements:

1. **Never use production data** - Use anonymized or synthetic DICOM files
2. **Secure storage** - Store fuzzed files in access-controlled locations
3. **Proper disposal** - Securely delete fuzzed files after testing
4. **Isolated networks** - Use isolated test networks, not production medical networks

## Malicious Sample Library

The `tools/generators/` directory contains intentionally malicious DICOM files.

| Category               | Risk   | Description                          |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| preamble_attacks/      | HIGH   | PE/ELF polyglots (CVE-2019-11687)    |
| cve_reproductions/     | HIGH   | Known CVE reproductions              |
| parser_stress/         | MEDIUM | DoS via deep nesting, truncation     |
| compliance_violations/ | LOW    | Malformed samples for parser testing |

### CVE Samples

| CVE            | Product    | Type                  | CVSS |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ---- |
| CVE-2019-11687 | DICOM Std  | PE/DICOM polyglot     | N/A  |
| CVE-2022-2119  | DCMTK      | Path traversal        | 7.5  |
| CVE-2022-2120  | DCMTK      | Path traversal        | 7.5  |
| CVE-2024-22100 | MicroDicom | Heap buffer overflow  | 7.8  |
| CVE-2024-28877 | MicroDicom | Stack buffer overflow | 8.7  |
| CVE-2025-1001  | RadiAnt    | Certificate bypass    | 5.7  |
| CVE-2025-11266 | GDCM       | Out-of-bounds write   | 6.6  |

### Safety Guidelines

1. **Isolate testing** - Use VMs, containers, or air-gapped systems
2. **Monitor resources** - Stress tests can cause resource exhaustion
3. **Never execute polyglots** - PE/ELF polyglots are valid executables
4. **Clean up after testing** - Remove generated samples when done

### Detection Tools

```bash
# Scan files for threats
dicom-fuzzer samples --scan ./files --recursive --json

# Sanitize suspicious files
dicom-fuzzer samples --sanitize suspicious.dcm
```
