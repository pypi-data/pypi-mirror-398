"""MoonLight-Style Corpus Distillation with Weighted Set Cover Problem Solver.

This module implements near-optimal corpus minimization using the Weighted
Set Cover Problem (WSCP) approach from MoonLight fuzzer.

MoonLight achieves 3x-100x smaller corpora than afl-cmin while maintaining
the same coverage, enabling faster fuzzing campaigns.

Key concepts:
- Each seed covers a set of coverage features
- WSCP finds minimum-weight subset covering all features
- Weight can be seed size, execution time, or custom metric
- Greedy approximation with lookahead for near-optimal results
