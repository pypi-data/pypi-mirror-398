           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.
        
           Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]

# PDFDancer Python Client

![PDFDancer logo](media/logo-orange-60h.webp)

**Stop fighting PDFs. Start editing them.**

Edit text in real-world PDFs—even ones you didn't create. Move images, reposition headers, and change fonts with
pixel-perfect control from Python. The same API is also available for TypeScript and Java.

> Need the raw API schema? The latest OpenAPI description lives in `docs/openapi.yml` and is published at
> https://bucket.pdfdancer.com/api-doc/development-0.0.yml.

## Highlights

- Locate paragraphs, text lines, images, vector paths, form fields, and pages by page number, coordinates, or text patterns.
- Edit existing content in place with fluent editors and context managers that apply changes safely.
- Programmatically control third-party PDFs—modify invoices, contracts, and reports you did not author.
- Add content with precise XY positioning using paragraph, image, and vector path builders with custom fonts and colors.
- Draw lines, rectangles, and Bezier curves with configurable stroke width, dash patterns, and fill colors.
- Redact sensitive content—replace text, images, or form fields with customizable placeholders.
- Export results as bytes for downstream processing or save directly to disk with one call.

## What Makes PDFDancer Different

- **Edit text in real-world PDFs**: Work with documents from customers, governments, or vendors—even ones you didn't create.
- **Pixel-perfect positioning**: Move or add elements at exact coordinates and keep the original layout intact.
- **Surgical text replacement**: Swap or rewrite paragraphs without reflowing the rest of the page.
- **Form manipulation**: Inspect, fill, and update AcroForm fields programmatically.
- **Coordinate-based selection**: Select objects by position, bounding box, or text patterns.
- **Vector graphics**: Draw lines, rectangles, and Bezier curves with full control over stroke and fill properties.
- **Secure redaction**: Permanently remove sensitive content and replace with customizable markers.
- **Real PDF editing**: Modify the underlying PDF structure instead of merely stamping overlays.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pdfdancer-client-python

# Editable install for local development
pip install -e .
```

Requires Python 3.10+ and a PDFDancer API token.

## Quick Start — Edit an Existing PDF

```python
from pathlib import Path
from pdfdancer import Color, PDFDancer, StandardFonts

with PDFDancer.open(
    pdf_data=Path("input.pdf"),
    token="your-api-token",             # optional when PDFDANCER_API_TOKEN is set
    base_url="https://api.pdfdancer.com",
) as pdf:
    # Locate and update an existing paragraph
    heading = pdf.page(0).select_paragraphs_starting_with("Executive Summary")[0]
    heading.move_to(72, 680)
    with heading.edit() as editor:
        editor.replace("Overview")

    # Add a new paragraph with precise placement
    pdf.new_paragraph() \
        .text("Generated with PDFDancer") \
        .font(StandardFonts.HELVETICA, 12) \
        .color(Color(70, 70, 70)) \
        .line_spacing(1.4) \
        .at(page_number=1, x=72, y=520) \
        .add()

    # Persist the modified document
    pdf.save("output.pdf")
    # or keep it in memory
    pdf_bytes = pdf.get_bytes()
```

## Create a Blank PDF

```python
from pathlib import Path
from pdfdancer import Color, PDFDancer, StandardFonts

with PDFDancer.new(token="your-api-token") as pdf:
    pdf.new_paragraph() \
        .text("Quarterly Summary") \
        .font(StandardFonts.TIMES_BOLD, 18) \
        .color(Color(10, 10, 80)) \
        .line_spacing(1.2) \
        .at(page_number=1, x=72, y=730) \
        .add()

    pdf.new_image() \
        .from_file(Path("logo.png")) \
        .at(page=0, x=420, y=710) \
        .add()

    pdf.save("summary.pdf")
```

## Work with Forms and Layout

```python
from pdfdancer import PDFDancer

with PDFDancer.open("contract.pdf") as pdf:
    # Inspect global document structure
    pages = pdf.pages()
    print("Total pages:", len(pages))

    # Update form fields
    signature = pdf.select_form_fields_by_name("signature")[0]
    signature.edit().value("Signed by Jane Doe").apply()

    # Trim or move content at specific coordinates
    images = pdf.page(1).select_images()
    for image in images:
        x = image.position.x()
        if x is not None and x < 100:
            image.delete()
```

Selectors return typed objects (`ParagraphObject`, `TextLineObject`, `ImageObject`, `FormFieldObject`, `PageClient`, …)
with helpers such as `delete()`, `move_to(x, y)`, `redact()`, or `edit()` depending on the object type.

**Singular selection methods** return the first match (or `None`) for convenience:

```python
# Instead of: paragraphs = page.select_paragraphs_starting_with("Invoice")[0]
paragraph = page.select_paragraph_starting_with("Invoice")  # Returns first match or None
image = page.select_image_at(100, 200)                      # Returns first match or None
field = pdf.select_form_field_by_name("email")              # Returns first match or None
```

## Draw Vector Paths

Add lines, curves, and shapes to your PDFs with fluent builders:

```python
from pdfdancer import PDFDancer, Color, Point

with PDFDancer.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    page = pdf.page(0)

    # Draw a simple line
    page.new_line() \
        .from_point(100, 700) \
        .to_point(500, 700) \
        .stroke_color(Color(0, 0, 255)) \
        .stroke_width(2.0) \
        .add()

    # Draw a rectangle
    page.new_rectangle() \
        .at_coordinates(100, 500) \
        .with_size(200, 100) \
        .stroke_color(Color(0, 0, 0)) \
        .fill_color(Color(255, 255, 200)) \
        .add()

    # Draw a bezier curve
    page.new_bezier() \
        .from_point(100, 400) \
        .control_point_1(150, 450) \
        .control_point_2(250, 350) \
        .to_point(300, 400) \
        .stroke_width(1.5) \
        .add()

    # Build complex paths with multiple segments
    page.new_path() \
        .stroke_color(Color(255, 0, 0)) \
        .add_line(Point(50, 200), Point(150, 200)) \
        .add_line(Point(150, 200), Point(100, 280)) \
        .add_line(Point(100, 280), Point(50, 200)) \
        .add()

    pdf.save("annotated.pdf")
```

## Redact Sensitive Content

Remove text, images, or form fields and replace them with redaction markers:

```python
from pdfdancer import PDFDancer, Color

with PDFDancer.open("confidential.pdf") as pdf:
    # Redact paragraphs containing sensitive patterns
    for para in pdf.select_paragraphs():
        if "SSN:" in para.text or "Password:" in para.text:
            para.redact("[REDACTED]")

    # Redact all images on a specific page
    for image in pdf.page(0).select_images():
        image.redact()

    # Bulk redact multiple objects with custom placeholder color
    form_fields = pdf.select_form_fields_by_name("credit_card")
    result = pdf.redact(form_fields, replacement="[REMOVED]", placeholder_color=Color(0, 0, 0))
    print(f"Redacted {result.count} items")

    pdf.save("redacted.pdf")
```

## Configuration

- Set `PDFDANCER_API_TOKEN` for authentication (preferred). `PDFDANCER_TOKEN` is also supported for backwards compatibility.
- Override the API host with `PDFDANCER_BASE_URL` (e.g., sandbox or local environments). Defaults to `https://api.pdfdancer.com`.
- Tune HTTP read timeouts via the `timeout` argument on `PDFDancer.open()` and `PDFDancer.new()` (default: 30 seconds).
- For testing against self-signed certificates, call `pdfdancer.set_ssl_verify(False)` to temporarily disable TLS verification.

## Error Handling

Operations raise subclasses of `PdfDancerException`:

- `ValidationException`: input validation problems (missing token, invalid coordinates, etc.).
- `FontNotFoundException`: requested font unavailable on the service.
- `HttpClientException`: transport or server errors with detailed context.
- `SessionException`: session creation and lifecycle failures.
- `RateLimitException`: API rate limit exceeded; includes retry-after timing.

Wrap automated workflows in `try/except` blocks to surface actionable errors to your users.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 or higher** (Python 3.9 has SSL issues with large file uploads)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **PDFDancer API token** for running end-to-end tests

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MenschMachine/pdfdancer-client-python.git
cd pdfdancer-client-python
```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt indicating the virtual environment is active.

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install the package in editable mode with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Alternatively, install runtime dependencies only:
# pip install -e .
```

This installs:
- The `pdfdancer` package in editable mode (changes reflect immediately)
- Development tooling including `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `pytest-mock`, `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `mypy`, `build`, and `twine`.

#### 4. Configure API Token

Set your PDFDancer API token as an environment variable:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
export PDFDANCER_API_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"

# On Windows (Command Prompt):
set PDFDANCER_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here

# On Windows (PowerShell):
$env:PDFDANCER_API_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"
```

For permanent configuration, add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.).

#### 5. Verify Installation

```bash
# Run the test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Run only unit tests (faster)
pytest tests/test_models.py -v

# Run end-to-end tests (requires API token)
pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

All tests should pass if everything is set up correctly.

### Common Development Tasks

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with verbose output
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py -v

# Run end-to-end tests only
pytest tests/e2e/ -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=pdfdancer --cov-report=term-missing
```

#### Building Distribution Packages

```bash
# Build wheel and source distribution
python -m build

# Verify the built packages
python -m twine check dist/*
```

Artifacts will be created in the `dist/` directory.

#### Publishing to PyPI

```bash
# Test upload to TestPyPI (recommended first)
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*

# Or use the release script
python release.py
```

#### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
black src tests
isort src tests

# Lint
flake8 src tests

# Type checking
mypy src/pdfdancer/
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Virtual Environment Issues

If `python -m venv venv` fails, ensure you have the `venv` module:

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-venv

# On macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install python@3.10
```

#### SSL Errors with Large Files

Upgrade to Python 3.10+ if you encounter SSL errors during large file uploads.

#### Import Errors

Ensure the virtual environment is activated and the package is installed in editable mode:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -e .
```

#### Test Failures

- Ensure `PDFDANCER_API_TOKEN` is set for e2e tests
- Check network connectivity to the PDFDancer API
- Verify you're using Python 3.10 or higher
