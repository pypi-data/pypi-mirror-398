          and not bytes (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/6).
      minor_changes:

  1.2.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - Add helper ``antsibull_docutils.rst_code_finder.find_code_blocks()`` that
          allows to find code blocks in RST files. This is useful for linters and
          also code that wants to modify the code block's contents. (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/12).
      release_summary: Feature release.
    fragments:
      - 1.2.0.yml

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Ensure that ``path`` and ``root_prefix`` for ``antsibull_docutils.rst_code_finder.find_code_blocks()``
          can actually be path-like objects (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/13).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix code block first content line detection (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/16).
      minor_changes:
        - Add functionality to parse documents, and to search for code blocks in parsed
          documents. This allows to perform other operations on the parsed document,
          instead of having to parse it multiple times (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/14,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/16).
        - Allow to find all literal blocks without language (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/15).
        - Allow to pass ``content_offset`` to ``mark_antsibull_code_block()`` for
          more precise locating (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/16).
