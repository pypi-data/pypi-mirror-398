# Continuous Ordinal Patterns (ContOP / COP) Library

Ordinal patterns are a way of analyzing time series in which values in sub-windows are studied in terms of their relative amplitude, or, in other words, of the permutation required to sort them. Such permutations are then represented as symbols, and their frequency is used to characterize the dynamics generating the time series. This, thus, represents a conceptually simple way of synthesizing a whole time series into a discrete distribution and, not surprisingly, has been applied to a plethora of real-world problems.

Continuous Ordinal Patterns (COP in short) turn this idea around: instead of using fixed patterns, we created a continuous version of these, that can be optimized to tackle a specific problem. In other words, instead of counting permutation patterns in a time series, we find the specific pattern that is better representing the same time series.

The underlying concept was firstly described in the paper:

Zanin, M. (2023). Continuous ordinal patterns: Creating a bridge between ordinal analysis and deep learning. Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, 33(3).
https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0136492


In addition, specific extensions and use cases have been discussed in multiple papers, as e.g.:

Zanin, M. (2024). Augmenting granger causality through continuous ordinal patterns. Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 128, 107606. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2023.107606
