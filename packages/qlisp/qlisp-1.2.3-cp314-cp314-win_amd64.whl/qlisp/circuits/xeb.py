    """XEB Fidelity

    Linear cross entropy between two probability distributions p and q is
    defined as:
        S(p, q) = SUM [ p * (1 - D * q) ]
    where D is the Hilbert space dimension.

    The fidelity is defined as normalized linear cross entropy between the
    ideal and measured distributions, with values between 0 and 1. In case
    of perfect fidelity, the value is 1, and in case of perfect mixing, the
    value is 0.

    The fidelity is calculated as:
            F = (S(p, q) - S(p, i)) / (S(p, p) - S(p, i))
    where p is the ideal distribution, q is the measured distribution, and
    i is the uniform distribution. In the case of the linear cross entropy,
    S(p, i) always equals 0, so the formula simplifies to:
            F = S(p, q) / S(p, p)

    The fidelity decays exponentially with the cycles, fitting the data with
            F = p ** cycle
    where p is the fidelity per cycle, it can be used to estimate the Pauli
    error rate:
            ep = (1 - p) / (1 - 1/D**2)
    Pauli error rate is the probability of a total Pauli error per cycle.
    The totalvPauli error is the sum of the all kinds of Pauli errors, and
    each kind of Pauli error assumes the same probability.

    Speckle Purity Benchmarking (SPB) is the method of measuring the state purity
    from raw XEB data. Assuming the depolarizing-channel model with polarization
    parameter p, we can model the quantum state as

    rho = p |psi> <psi| + (1 - p) I / D

    where D is the Hilbert space dimension, and p is the probability of a pure state
    |psi> (which is not necessarily known to us). The Speckle Purity is defined as

    The variance of the experimental probabilities will be p^2 times the Porter-Thomas
