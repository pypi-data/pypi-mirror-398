@dataclass
class CSIDriverSpec(DictMixin):
    r"""CSIDriverSpec is the specification of a CSIDriver.

      **parameters**

      * **attachRequired** ``Optional[bool]`` - attachRequired indicates this CSI volume driver requires an attach operation
        (because it implements the CSI ControllerPublishVolume() method), and that the
        Kubernetes attach detach controller should call the attach volume interface
        which checks the volumeattachment status and waits until the volume is
        attached before proceeding to mounting. The CSI external-attacher coordinates
        with CSI volume driver and updates the volumeattachment status when the attach
        operation is complete. If the value is specified to false, the attach
        operation will be skipped. Otherwise the attach operation will be called.
        This field is immutable.
      * **fsGroupPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - fsGroupPolicy defines if the underlying volume supports changing ownership and
        permission of the volume before being mounted. Refer to the specific
        FSGroupPolicy values for additional details.
        This field was immutable in Kubernetes < 1.29 and now is mutable.
        Defaults to ReadWriteOnceWithFSType, which will examine each volume to
        determine if Kubernetes should modify ownership and permissions of the volume.
        With the default policy the defined fsGroup will only be applied if a fstype
        is defined and the volume's access mode contains ReadWriteOnce.
      * **nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds** ``Optional[int]`` - nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds specifies the interval between periodic
        updates of the CSINode allocatable capacity for this driver. When set, both
        periodic updates and updates triggered by capacity-related failures are
        enabled. If not set, no updates occur (neither periodic nor upon detecting
        capacity-related failures), and the allocatable.count remains static. The
        minimum allowed value for this field is 10 seconds.
        This is a beta feature and requires the MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount feature
        gate to be enabled.
        This field is mutable.
      * **podInfoOnMount** ``Optional[bool]`` - podInfoOnMount indicates this CSI volume driver requires additional pod
        information (like podName, podUID, etc.) during mount operations, if set to
        true. If set to false, pod information will not be passed on mount. Default is
        false.
        The CSI driver specifies podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If true,
        Kubelet will pass pod information as VolumeContext in the CSI
        NodePublishVolume() calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and
        validating the information passed in as VolumeContext.
        The following VolumeContext will be passed if podInfoOnMount is set to true.
        This list might grow, but the prefix will be used.
        "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name": pod.Name "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace":
        pod.Namespace "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid": string(pod.UID)
        "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral": "true" if the volume is an ephemeral inline
        volume
                                        defined by a CSIVolumeSource, otherwise
        "false"
        "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral" is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only
        required for drivers which support both the "Persistent" and "Ephemeral"
        VolumeLifecycleMode. Other drivers can leave pod info disabled and/or ignore
        this field. As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn't support this field, drivers can only
        support one mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines
        which mode that is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver.
        This field was immutable in Kubernetes < 1.29 and now is mutable.
      * **requiresRepublish** ``Optional[bool]`` - requiresRepublish indicates the CSI driver wants `NodePublishVolume` being
        periodically called to reflect any possible change in the mounted volume. This
        field defaults to false.
        Note: After a successful initial NodePublishVolume call, subsequent calls to
        NodePublishVolume should only update the contents of the volume. New mount
        points will not be seen by a running container.
      * **seLinuxMount** ``Optional[bool]`` - seLinuxMount specifies if the CSI driver supports "-o context" mount option.
        When "true", the CSI driver must ensure that all volumes provided by this CSI
        driver can be mounted separately with different `-o context` options. This is
        typical for storage backends that provide volumes as filesystems on block
        devices or as independent shared volumes. Kubernetes will call NodeStage /
        NodePublish with "-o context=xyz" mount option when mounting a
        ReadWriteOncePod volume used in Pod that has explicitly set SELinux context.
        In the future, it may be expanded to other volume AccessModes. In any case,
        Kubernetes will ensure that the volume is mounted only with a single SELinux
        context.
        When "false", Kubernetes won't pass any special SELinux mount options to the
        driver. This is typical for volumes that represent subdirectories of a bigger
        shared filesystem.
        Default is "false".
      * **serviceAccountTokenInSecrets** ``Optional[bool]`` - serviceAccountTokenInSecrets is an opt-in for CSI drivers to indicate that
        service account tokens should be passed via the Secrets field in
        NodePublishVolumeRequest instead of the VolumeContext field. The CSI
        specification provides a dedicated Secrets field for sensitive information
        like tokens, which is the appropriate mechanism for handling credentials. This
        addresses security concerns where sensitive tokens were being logged as part
        of volume context.
        When "true", kubelet will pass the tokens only in the Secrets field with the
        key "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens". The CSI driver must be updated
        to read tokens from the Secrets field instead of VolumeContext.
        When "false" or not set, kubelet will pass the tokens in VolumeContext with
        the key "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens" (existing behavior). This
        maintains backward compatibility with existing CSI drivers.
        This field can only be set when TokenRequests is configured. The API server
        will reject CSIDriver specs that set this field without TokenRequests.
        Default behavior if unset is to pass tokens in the VolumeContext field.
      * **storageCapacity** ``Optional[bool]`` - storageCapacity indicates that the CSI volume driver wants pod scheduling to
        consider the storage capacity that the driver deployment will report by
        creating CSIStorageCapacity objects with capacity information, if set to true.
        The check can be enabled immediately when deploying a driver. In that case,
        provisioning new volumes with late binding will pause until the driver
        deployment has published some suitable CSIStorageCapacity object.
        Alternatively, the driver can be deployed with the field unset or false and it
        can be flipped later when storage capacity information has been published.
        This field was immutable in Kubernetes <= 1.22 and now is mutable.
      * **tokenRequests** ``Optional[List[TokenRequest]]`` - tokenRequests indicates the CSI driver needs pods' service account tokens it
        is mounting volume for to do necessary authentication. Kubelet will pass the
        tokens in VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume calls. The CSI driver
        should parse and validate the following VolumeContext:
        "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens": {
          "<audience>": {
            "token": <token>,
            "expirationTimestamp": <expiration timestamp in RFC3339>,
          },
          ...
        }
        Note: Audience in each TokenRequest should be different and at most one token
        is empty string. To receive a new token after expiry, RequiresRepublish can be
        used to trigger NodePublishVolume periodically.
      * **volumeLifecycleModes** ``Optional[List[str]]`` - volumeLifecycleModes defines what kind of volumes this CSI volume driver
        supports. The default if the list is empty is "Persistent", which is the usage
        defined by the CSI specification and implemented in Kubernetes via the usual
        PV/PVC mechanism.
        The other mode is "Ephemeral". In this mode, volumes are defined inline inside
        the pod spec with CSIVolumeSource and their lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle
        of that pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it is only going to get
        a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume.
        For more information about implementing this mode, see
        https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html A driver
        can support one or more of these modes and more modes may be added in the
        future.
        This field is beta. This field is immutable.

      For example this can express things like: - StorageClass "standard" has "1234

      The producer of these objects can decide which approach is more suitable.
      
      They are consumed by the kube-scheduler when a CSI driver opts into
      capacity-aware scheduling with CSIDriverSpec.StorageCapacity. The scheduler
      compares the MaximumVolumeSize against the requested size of pending volumes
      to filter out unsuitable nodes. If MaximumVolumeSize is unset, it falls back

      * **storageClassName** ``str`` - storageClassName represents the name of the StorageClass that the reported
        capacity applies to. It must meet the same requirements as the name of a
