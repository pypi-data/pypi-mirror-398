class ClusterTrustBundle(DictMixin):
    r"""ClusterTrustBundle is a cluster-scoped container for X.509 trust anchors (root
      certificates).
      
      ClusterTrustBundle objects are considered to be readable by any authenticated
      user in the cluster, because they can be mounted by pods using the
      `clusterTrustBundle` projection.  All service accounts have read access to
      ClusterTrustBundles by default.  Users who only have namespace-level access to
      a cluster can read ClusterTrustBundles by impersonating a serviceaccount that
      they have access to.
      
      It can be optionally associated with a particular assigner, in which case it
      contains one valid set of trust anchors for that signer. Signers may have
      multiple associated ClusterTrustBundles; each is an independent set of trust
      anchors for that signer. Admission control is used to enforce that only users
      with permissions on the signer can create or modify the corresponding bundle.

      **parameters**

      * **trustBundle** ``str`` - trustBundle contains the individual X.509 trust anchors for this bundle, as
        PEM bundle of PEM-wrapped, DER-formatted X.509 certificates.
        The data must consist only of PEM certificate blocks that parse as valid X.509
        certificates.  Each certificate must include a basic constraints extension
        with the CA bit set.  The API server will reject objects that contain
        duplicate certificates, or that use PEM block headers.
        Users of ClusterTrustBundles, including Kubelet, are free to reorder and
        deduplicate certificate blocks in this file according to their own logic, as
        well as to drop PEM block headers and inter-block data.
      * **signerName** ``Optional[str]`` - signerName indicates the associated signer, if any.
        In order to create or update a ClusterTrustBundle that sets signerName, you
        must have the following cluster-scoped permission: group=certificates.k8s.io
        resource=signers resourceName=<the signer name> verb=attest.
        If signerName is not empty, then the ClusterTrustBundle object must be named
        with the signer name as a prefix (translating slashes to colons). For example,
        for the signer name `example.com/foo`, valid ClusterTrustBundle object names
        include `example.com:foo:abc` and `example.com:foo:v1`.

class PodCertificateRequestSpec(DictMixin):
    r"""PodCertificateRequestSpec describes the certificate request.  All fields are
      immutable after creation.

      **parameters**

      * **nodeName** ``str`` - nodeName is the name of the node the pod is assigned to.
      * **nodeUID** ``str`` - nodeUID is the UID of the node the pod is assigned to.
      * **pkixPublicKey** ``str`` - pkixPublicKey is the PKIX-serialized public key the signer will issue the
        certificate to.
        The key must be one of RSA3072, RSA4096, ECDSAP256, ECDSAP384, ECDSAP521, or
        ED25519. Note that this list may be expanded in the future.
        Signer implementations do not need to support all key types supported by
        kube-apiserver and kubelet.  If a signer does not support the key type used
        for a given PodCertificateRequest, it must deny the request by setting a
        status.conditions entry with a type of "Denied" and a reason of
        "UnsupportedKeyType". It may also suggest a key type that it does support in
        the message field.
      * **podName** ``str`` - podName is the name of the pod into which the certificate will be mounted.
      * **podUID** ``str`` - podUID is the UID of the pod into which the certificate will be mounted.
      * **proofOfPossession** ``str`` - proofOfPossession proves that the requesting kubelet holds the private key
        corresponding to pkixPublicKey.
        It is contructed by signing the ASCII bytes of the pod's UID using
        `pkixPublicKey`.
        kube-apiserver validates the proof of possession during creation of the
        PodCertificateRequest.
        If the key is an RSA key, then the signature is over the ASCII bytes of the
        pod UID, using RSASSA-PSS from RFC 8017 (as implemented by the golang function
        crypto/rsa.SignPSS with nil options).
        If the key is an ECDSA key, then the signature is as described by [SEC 1,
        Version 2.0](https://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf) (as implemented by the golang
        library function crypto/ecdsa.SignASN1)
        If the key is an ED25519 key, the the signature is as described by the
        [ED25519 Specification](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) (as implemented by the
        golang library crypto/ed25519.Sign).
      * **serviceAccountName** ``str`` - serviceAccountName is the name of the service account the pod is running as.
      * **serviceAccountUID** ``str`` - serviceAccountUID is the UID of the service account the pod is running as.
      * **signerName** ``str`` - signerName indicates the requested signer.
        All signer names beginning with `kubernetes.io` are reserved for use by the
        Kubernetes project.  There is currently one well-known signer documented by
        the Kubernetes project, `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-pod`, which will
        issue client certificates understood by kube-apiserver.  It is currently
        unimplemented.
      * **maxExpirationSeconds** ``Optional[int]`` - maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the certificate.
        If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver will
        reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable value is
        7862400 (91 days).
        The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
        lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600 seconds
        (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver. `kubernetes.io`
        signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime longer than 24 hours.
      * **unverifiedUserAnnotations** ``Optional[dict]`` - unverifiedUserAnnotations allow pod authors to pass additional information to
        the signer implementation.  Kubernetes does not restrict or validate this
        metadata in any way.
        Entries are subject to the same validation as object metadata annotations,
        with the addition that all keys must be domain-prefixed. No restrictions are
        placed on values, except an overall size limitation on the entire field.
        Signers should document the keys and values they support.  Signers should deny
        requests that contain keys they do not recognize.

      **parameters**

      * **beginRefreshAt** ``Optional[meta_v1.Time]`` - beginRefreshAt is the time at which the kubelet should begin trying to refresh
        the certificate.  This field is set via the /status subresource, and must be
        set at the same time as certificateChain.  Once populated, this field is
        immutable.
        This field is only a hint.  Kubelet may start refreshing before or after this
        time if necessary.
      * **certificateChain** ``Optional[str]`` - certificateChain is populated with an issued certificate by the signer. This
        field is set via the /status subresource. Once populated, this field is

        If the certificate signing request is denied, a condition of type "Denied" is
        added and this field remains empty. If the signer cannot issue the
        certificate, a condition of type "Failed" is added and this field remains
        empty.
        Validation requirements:
         1. certificateChain must consist of one or more PEM-formatted certificates.
         2. Each entry must be a valid PEM-wrapped, DER-encoded ASN.1 Certificate as
            described in section 4 of RFC5280.
        If more than one block is present, and the definition of the requested
        spec.signerName does not indicate otherwise, the first block is the issued
        certificate, and subsequent blocks should be treated as intermediate
        certificates and presented in TLS handshakes.  When projecting the chain into
        a pod volume, kubelet will drop any data in-between the PEM blocks, as well as
        any PEM block headers.
      * **conditions** ``Optional[List[meta_v1.Condition]]`` - conditions applied to the request.
        The types "Issued", "Denied", and "Failed" have special handling.  At most one
        of these conditions may be present, and they must have status "True".
        If the request is denied with `Reason=UnsupportedKeyType`, the signer may
        suggest a key type that will work in the message field.
      * **notAfter** ``Optional[meta_v1.Time]`` - notAfter is the time at which the certificate expires.  The value must be the
        same as the notAfter value in the leaf certificate in certificateChain.  This
        field is set via the /status subresource.  Once populated, it is immutable.
        The signer must set this field at the same time it sets certificateChain.
      * **notBefore** ``Optional[meta_v1.Time]`` - notBefore is the time at which the certificate becomes valid.  The value must
        be the same as the notBefore value in the leaf certificate in
        certificateChain.  This field is set via the /status subresource.  Once
