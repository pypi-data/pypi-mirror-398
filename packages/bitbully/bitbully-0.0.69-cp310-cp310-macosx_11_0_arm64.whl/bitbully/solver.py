class BitBully:
    """A Connect Four AI agent with optional opening book support.

    Todo:
    - We have to describe the scoring scheme (range of values and their meaning).

    This class is a high-level Python wrapper around
    [`bitbully_core.BitBullyCore`][src.bitbully.bitbully_core.BitBullyCore].
    It integrates the packaged *BitBully Databases* opening books and
    operates on [`bitbully.Board`][src.bitbully.board.Board] objects.

    Notes:
        - If an opening book is enabled, it is used automatically for
          early-game positions.
        - For deeper positions or positions outside the database horizon,
          the engine falls back to search-based evaluation.

    Example:
        ```python
        from bitbully import BitBully, Board

        agent = BitBully()
        board, _ = Board.random_board(14, forbid_direct_win=True)
        print(board)

        # All three search methods should agree on the score
        score_mtdf = agent.mtdf(board)
        score_negamax = agent.negamax(board)
        score_null_window = agent.null_window(board)
        assert score_negamax == score_null_window == score_mtdf
