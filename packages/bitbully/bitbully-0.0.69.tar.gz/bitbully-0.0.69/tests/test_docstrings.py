    This function scans a docstring for fenced code blocks (e.g., those enclosed

    each block's language identifier and its dedented body. If no language tag
    is provided after the opening fence, the language is returned as an empty
    string (`''`).

    The body of each block is automatically dedented and trimmed, so it can be
    executed or compared consistently regardless of indentation levels.

    Args:
        doc (str | None): The input docstring or Markdown text to parse.
            If `None` or empty, an empty list is returned.

              (empty string if no language tag is provided).
            - `body` is the dedented and trimmed content of the fenced block.
