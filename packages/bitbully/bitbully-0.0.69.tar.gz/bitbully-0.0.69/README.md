## Usage

### Start with a simple Widget on Colab

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/MarkusThill/BitBully/blob/master/notebooks/game_widget.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

### BitBully Lib (recommended)

tbd

### BitBully Core (advanced)

Use the `BitBullyCore` and `BoardCore` classes directly in Python:

#### BoardCore Examples

The low-level `BoardCore` API gives you full control over Connect-4 positions:
you can play moves, generate random boards, mirror positions, and query win
conditions or hashes.

##### Create and Print a Board

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()
print(board)          # Human-readable 7x6 board
print(board.movesLeft())   # 42 on an empty board
print(board.countTokens()) # 0 on an empty board
```

---

##### Play Moves and Check for Winning Positions

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()

# Play a small sequence of moves (columns 0–6)
for col in [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3]:
    assert board.play(col)

print(board)

# Check if the side to move has an immediate winning move
print(board.canWin())      # False
print(board.hasWin())      # True, since the last move created 4-in-a-row
```

You can also check if a **specific column** is a winning move:

```python
board = bbc.BoardCore()
board.setBoard([3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4])

print(board.canWin())  # True
print(board.canWin(1))  # True  – playing in column 1 wins
print(board.canWin(3))  # False – no win in column 3
```

---

##### Set a Board from a Move List or Array

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()

# From a move sequence (recommended)
assert board.setBoard([0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0])

# Convert to 7x6 array (columns × rows)
array = board.toArray()
print(len(array), len(array[0]))  # 7 x 6

# From a 7x6 array of tokens (1 = Yellow, 2 = Red)
array_board = [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(7)]
array_board[3][0] = 1  # Yellow in center column bottom row
b2 = bbc.BoardCore()
assert b2.setBoard(array_board)
```

---

##### Generate Random Boards

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board, moves = bbc.BoardCore.randomBoard(10, True)

print(board)   # Random, valid board
print(moves)   # List of 10 column indices
print(board.canWin())  # Usually False for random boards in this setup
```

---

##### Mirroring Boards and Symmetry

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()
board.setBoard([0, 1, 2])      # Left side

mirrored = board.mirror()      # Mirror around center column
print(board)
print(mirrored)

# Double-mirroring returns the original position
assert board == mirrored.mirror()
```

---

##### Hashing, Equality, and Copies

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

b1 = bbc.BoardCore()
b2 = bbc.BoardCore()

moves = [0, 1, 2, 3]
for m in moves:
    b1.play(m)
    b2.play(m)

assert b1 == b2
assert b1.hash() == b2.hash()
assert b1.uid() == b2.uid()

# Copying a board
b3 = b1.copy()           # or bbc.BoardCore(b1)
assert b3 == b1

b3.play(4)               # Modify the copy
assert b3 != b1
assert b3.hash() != b1.hash()
```

These examples are based on the internal test suite and show typical ways of
interacting with `BoardCore` programmatically.

#### BitBullyCore: Connect-4 Solver Examples

The `BitBullyCore` module provides a high-performance Connect-4 solver written in C++
and exposed to Python. You can evaluate positions, score all legal moves, or run the
full MTD(f) search.

---

##### Solve a Position with MTD(f)

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

# Construct a position: alternate moves into the center column
board = bbc.BoardCore()
for _ in range(6):
    board.play(3)  # Column 3

solver = bbc.BitBullyCore()
score = solver.mtdf(board, first_guess=0)

print("Best score:", score)
```

`mtdf` returns an integer score from the perspective of the **side to move**
(positive = winning, negative = losing).

---

##### Score All Moves in a Position

`scoreMoves(board)` returns a list of 7 integers:
the evaluated score for playing in each column (0–6).
Illegal moves (full columns) are still included in the list.

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()
board.setBoard([3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2])

solver = bbc.BitBullyCore()
scores = solver.scoreMoves(board)

print("Move scores:", scores)
# Example output:
# [-3, -3, 1, -4, 3, -2, -2]
```

---

##### Using the Solver in a Loop (Move Selection)

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc
import time

board = bbc.BoardCore()
solver = bbc.BitBullyCore()

for move in [3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]:  # Example opening
    board.play(move)

start = time.perf_counter()
scores = solver.scoreMoves(board)
best_move = max(range(7), key=lambda c: scores[c])
print(f"Time: {round(time.perf_counter() - start, 2)} seconds!")
print("Scores:", scores)
print("Best move suggestion:", best_move)
# best move is into column 4
```

---

##### Further Examples using the BitBully Solver

You can initialize a board using an array with shape `(7, 6)` (columns first) and solve it:

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core

# Define a Connect-4 board as an array (7 columns x 6 rows)
# You may also define the board using a numpy array if numpy is installed
# 0 = Empty, 1 = Yellow, 2 = Red
# Here, the left column represents the bottom row of the board
board_array = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

# Convert the array to the BoardCore board
board = bitbully_core.BoardCore()
assert board.setBoard(board_array), "Invalid board!"

print(board)

# Solve the position
solver = bitbully_core.BitBullyCore()
score = solver.mtdf(board, first_guess=0)
print(f"Best score for the current board: {score}") # expected score: 1
```

Run the Bitbully solver with an opening book (here: 12-ply opening book with winning distances):

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core as bbc
import bitbully_databases as bbd
import importlib.resources

db_path = bbd.BitBullyDatabases.get_database_path("12-ply-dist")
bitbully = bbc.BitBullyCore(db_path)
b = bbc.BoardCore()  # Empty board
bitbully.scoreMoves(b)  # expected result: [-2, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, -2]
```

#### Further Usage Examples for BitBully Core

Create all Positions with (up to) `n` tokens starting from Board `b`:

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core as bbc

b = bbc.BoardCore()  # empty board
board_list_3ply = b.allPositions(3, True)  # All positions with exactly 3 tokens
len(board_list_3ply)  # should be 238 according to https://oeis.org/A212693
```

#### Opening Book Examples

BitBully Databases provide fast lookup tables (opening books) for Connect-4, allowing you to query
evaluated positions, check if a board is known, and retrieve win/loss/distance values.

##### Load an Opening Book

```python
import bitbully_databases as bbd
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

# Load the 8-ply opening book (no distances)
db_path = bbd.BitBullyDatabases.get_database_path("8-ply")
book = bbc.OpeningBookCore(db_path, is_8ply=True, with_distances=False)

print(book.getBookSize())  # e.g., 34515
print(book.getNPly())      # -> 8
```

---

##### Accessing Entries

Each entry consists of `(key, value)` where:
- **key** is the Huffman-encoded board state
- **value** is the evaluation (win/loss/draw or distance)

```python
k, v = book.getEntry(0)
print(k, v)
```

---

##### Evaluating a Board Position

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()
board.setBoard([2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5])  # Sequence of column moves

value = book.getBoardValue(board)
print("Evaluation:", value)
```

---

##### Check Whether a Position Is in the Opening Book

The books only contain one variant for mirror-symmetric positions:

```python
board = bbc.BoardCore()
board.setBoard([1, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3])

print(book.isInBook(board))              # e.g., False
print(book.isInBook(board.mirror()))     # e.g., True, checks symmetric position
```
