    "# Distributional Gauss curvature\n",
    "This is the first of several notebooks to present how to compute (distributional) curvature quantities from a Regge metric $g_h$, i.e. a discretization of a smooth metric $g$ tensor by Regge finite elements. We start with the Gauss curvature for a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Although this setting is easiest, it highlights the remaining curvature quantities' strategies and methods. Thus, we will describe the components and ideas in detail. We will show how to define and approximate the Gauss curvature of a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold, where its exact metric $g$ is discretized by a Regge metric $g_h$. Its analysis is postponed to [here](distributional_gauss_curvature_analysis.ipynb). The notebook is based on the following works: [Gawlik. *High-Order Approximation of Gaussian Curvature with Regge Finite Elements*, *SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis* (2020).](https://doi.org/10.1137/19M1255549), [Berchenko-Kogan, Gawlik. *Finite Element Approximation of the Levi-Civita Connection and Its Curvature in Two Dimensions*, *Found Comput Math* (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10208-022-09597-1), and [Gopalakrishnan, Neunteufel, Schöberl, Wardetzky. *Analysis of curvature approximations via covariant curl and incompatibility for Regge metrics*, *The SMAI Journal of computational mathematics* (2023).](https://doi.org/10.5802/smai-jcm.98).\n",

    "## Gauss curvature as a nonlinear distribution\n",

    "we see that the Gauss curvature is a nonlinear (quasi-linear)  second-order differential operator of the metric. As discussed in the [introduction of the Regge metrics](regge_metric.ipynb), these finite elements are solely tangential-tangential continuous. Therefore, derivatives have to be understood in the sense of distributions. However, distributions are classically only available for linear differential operators, not nonlinear ones!\n",

    "If the metric $g_h$ would be globally smooth on the triangulation $\\mathcal{T}$ of $M$, then the geodesic curvature computed at an internal edge $E$ with respect to the adjacent two triangles would coincide up to a sign due to the jump of the normal vector. Thus, the jump of the geodesic curvature would be zero, $[\\![\\kappa_g]\\!]_E=0$. However, as the Regge metric is only $tt$-continuous, the jump of the geodesic curvature won't vanish in general. The same argument can be made at the triangulation's internal vertices $V\\in\\mathcal{V}$. For a smooth metric, computing the sum of the inner angles of adjacent triangles with respect to the metric would always give $2\\pi$, $\\sphericalangle_V:=\\sum_{T\\supset V}\\sphericalangle_V^T(g)-2\\pi=0$. Here, $\\sphericalangle_V^T(g):=\\arccos(t_1,t_2)$ measures the internal angle with respect to the metric $g$, where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the two unit tangent vectors starting at $V$ and going in the direction of the edges attached to $V$ on the element $T$.
