Covariant derivatives are handled in details in [following notebook](covariant_derivatives.ipynb). We also present some Riemannian metrics in two and three dimensions.

    "Let $(M,g)$ be an $N$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with metric tensor $g$. That means $M$ is a smooth manifold, and $g$ is a symmetric and positive definite bilinear form on the tangent space of $M$. If $g$ has signature $-+\\dots+$, then $(M,g)$ is called a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. For instance, in general relativity, the metric has the signature $-+++$, where the associated negative coordinate corresponds to time. For numerical experiments and simulations we will approximate the exact metric by [Regge finite elements](regge_metric.ipynb).\n",
