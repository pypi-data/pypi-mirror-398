"""
Dedicated class for handling comparison of List[primitive] fields.

This class extracts the primitive list comparison logic from StructuredModel to improve
code organization and maintainability. The extraction preserves existing behavior
exactly, maintaining the hierarchical structure for API consistency.

Design Decision: Universal Hierarchical Structure
=================================================
This comparator returns a hierarchical structure {"overall": {...}, "fields": {...}} even for
primitive lists (List[str], List[int], etc.) to maintain API consistency across all field types.

Why this approach:
- CONSISTENCY: All list fields use the same access pattern: cm["fields"][name]["overall"]
- TEST COMPATIBILITY: Multiple test files expect this pattern for both primitive and structured lists
- PREDICTABLE API: Consumers don't need to check field type before accessing metrics

Trade-offs:
- Creates vestigial "fields": {} objects for primitive lists that will never be populated
- Slightly more verbose structure than necessary for leaf nodes
- Architecturally less pure than type-based structure (primitives flat, structured hierarchical)

        - Slightly more verbose structure than necessary for leaf nodes
        - Architecturally less pure than type-based structure (primitives flat, structured hierarchical)

        Alternative considered but rejected:
        - Type-based structure where List[primitive] → flat, List[StructuredModel] → hierarchical
        - Would require updating multiple test files and consumer code to handle mixed access patterns
        - More architecturally pure but breaks backward compatibility

        Future consideration: If we ever refactor the entire confusion matrix API, we could move to
        type-based structure where the presence of "fields" key indicates structured vs primitive.

            gt_list: Ground truth list of primitive values
