# PMMV - Python Mass Move

PMMV is a tool for batch renaming/moving files with an interactive editor. Most
useful when you need to rename a huge amount of files and could benefit from
scripted macros. Works best with [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd).

Features:

 - Rename files in the comfort of your favourite editor.
 - .pmmv.undo files allow you to undo your last renaming!
 - Git integration for renaming files.

## Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
uv tool install pmmv
```

## Usage

This was built with vim in mind, though any editor will work. The script will
look at the `EDITOR` variable to determine which editor to use. For instance,
`export EDITOR=code` would open vscode.

```bash
uvx pmmv *.txt readme.md
# Or include a full directory
uvx pmmv my_dir/
```

Or pipe files from another command:

```bash
find . -name "*.txt" | uvx pmmv -
# Or try the much faster fd-find
fd -e txt | uvx pmmv -
```

## Development

Setup with uv.

```
uv venv
. .venv/bin/activate
uv pip sync
```

Tests are run through pytest.

```
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

## Acknowledgements

This is my first project that's almost entirely vibe-coded. I used an initial
prompt to claude sonnet 4.5 which can be seen at `docs/initial_prompt.txt`. I
then used qwen3-coder-30b-a3 from
[cpatonn](https://huggingface.co/cpatonn/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-AWQ-4bit)
through vllm 0.11.0 and Qwen Code 0.0.14 to iterate further on the code.
