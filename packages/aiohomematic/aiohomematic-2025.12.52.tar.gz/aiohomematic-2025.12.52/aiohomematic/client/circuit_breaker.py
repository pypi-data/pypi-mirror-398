Circuit Breaker pattern implementation for RPC calls.

Overview
--------
The Circuit Breaker prevents retry-storms when backends are unavailable by
tracking failures and temporarily blocking requests when a failure threshold
is reached. This protects both the client (from wasting resources on doomed
requests) and the backend (from being overwhelmed during recovery).

State Machine
-------------
The circuit breaker has three states:

    CLOSED (normal operation)
        │
        │ failure_threshold failures
        ▼
    OPEN (fast-fail all requests)
        │
        │ recovery_timeout elapsed
        ▼
    HALF_OPEN (test one request)
        │
        ├── success_threshold successes → CLOSED
        └── failure → OPEN

Example Usage
-------------
    from aiohomematic.client.circuit_breaker import CircuitBreaker, CircuitBreakerConfig

    breaker = CircuitBreaker(
        config=CircuitBreakerConfig(
            failure_threshold=5,
            recovery_timeout=30.0,
            success_threshold=2,
        ),
        interface_id="BidCos-RF",
    )

    # In request handler:
    if not breaker.is_available:
        raise NoConnectionException("Circuit breaker is open")

    try:
        result = await do_request()
        breaker.record_success()
        return result
    except Exception:
        breaker.record_failure()
        raise
