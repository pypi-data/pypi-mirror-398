# Unofficial PetsSeries API Client

_Disclaimer: This is an unofficial Python client for the PetsSeries API. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way connected to the official PetsSeries, Versuni or Philips companies._

## Introduction
The Unofficial PetsSeries API Client is a Python library designed to interact with the PetsSeries backend services. It provides asynchronous methods to manage user information, homes, devices, meals, events, and more. This client handles authentication, token refreshing, and provides a convenient interface for integrating PetsSeries functionalities into your Python applications.

## Features
- **Authentication Management:** Handles access and refresh tokens, including automatic refreshing when expired.
- **PKCE OAuth 2.0 Flow:** Full support for the secure PKCE authentication flow used by the official app.
- **Comprehensive API Coverage:** Methods to interact with user info, homes, devices, meals, events, and device settings.
- **Home Management:** Create, rename, delete homes and manage home sharing invitations.
- **Device Management:** Add, rename, delete devices and manage device settings.
- **Schedule Management:** Methods to manage meal schedules.
- **Food Dispenser Control:** Methods to control food dispensers (Requires Tuya).
- **Event Parsing:** Automatically parses different event types into structured Python objects.
- **Discovery Service:** Access global configuration and API URLs without authentication.

## Features to be Added
- **Camera Feed Access:** Methods to access the camera feed

(feel free to PR if you manage to implement any of these features)


## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed. You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Authentication

This client supports two methods of authentication with the PetsSeries API:

### Method 1: PKCE OAuth Flow (Recommended)

The library includes full support for the PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) OAuth 2.0 flow, which is the same method used by the official Philips app. This is more secure and doesn't require manually extracting tokens.

```python
import asyncio
from petsseries import AuthManager

async def authenticate():
    async with AuthManager() as auth:
        # Step 1: Generate authorization URL
        auth_data = await auth.get_authorization_url()
        
        print("Please open this URL in your browser:")
        print(auth_data["authorization_url"])
        print()
        print("After logging in, you'll be redirected to 'paw://login?code=...'")
        print("Copy that entire URL and paste it below:")
        
        callback_url = input("Callback URL: ").strip()
        
        # Step 2: Parse the callback URL
        callback_data = AuthManager.parse_callback_url(callback_url)
        
        # Step 3: Exchange authorization code for tokens
        tokens = await auth.exchange_authorization_code(
            authorization_code=callback_data["code"],
            code_verifier=auth_data["code_verifier"]
        )
        
        print(f"Access Token: {tokens['access_token'][:50]}...")
        print(f"Refresh Token: {tokens['refresh_token'][:50]}...")
        print("Tokens have been saved to tokens.json")

asyncio.run(authenticate())
```

### Method 2: Manual Token Extraction (Fallback)

If you prefer to extract tokens manually:

1. **Login via Web Interface:**
   - Navigate to [PetsSeries Appliance Login](https://www.home.id/find-appliance).
   - Select a PetsSeries product (Starts with PAW) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Retrieve Tokens:**
   - After logging in, you will be redirected to a "Thanks for your purchase" screen.
   - Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
   - Go to the Application tab and inspect the cookies.
   - Locate and copy the `cc-access-token` and `cc-refresh-token` from the cookies.

3. **Provide Tokens to the Client:**
   - You can provide the `access_token` and `refresh_token` when initializing the client.

### Example Initialization with Tokens

```python
import asyncio
from petsseries import PetsSeriesClient

async def main():
    client = PetsSeriesClient(
        access_token="your_access_token_here",
        refresh_token="your_refresh_token_here"
    )
    await client.initialize()
    # Your code here

asyncio.run(main())
```

After the first run, the tokens will be saved automatically, and you won't need to provide them again unless they are invalidated.

## Tuya Integration (Optional)

The client also supports integration with Tuya devices, which is required for controlling features such as food dispensers. To enable this, you will need to provide the following:

- client_id: This can be found in the PetsSeries app's device screen.

- ip: The ip of the device.

- local_key: You can extract this from the device using a rooted phone and running frida-trace as shown below:
    
```bash 
frida-trace -H 127.0.0.1:27042 --decorate -j '*!*encodeString*'  -f com.versuni.petsseries. -o <a folder location to save frida_trace outputs to a local file>
```
Then, search for the localKey in the logs.


### Example Initialization with Tokens and Tuya Credentials

```python
import asyncio
from petsseries import PetsSeriesClient

async def main():
    client = PetsSeriesClient(
        access_token="your_access_token_here",
        refresh_token="your_refresh
        tuya_credentials={"client_id": "CLIENT_ID", "ip": "IP_ADDRESS", "local_key": "LOCAL_KEY"}
    )
    await client.initialize()
    # Your code here

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Usage
### Initialization
Initialize the PetsSeriesClient with optional access_token and refresh_token. If tokens are not provided, ensure that tokens.json exists with valid tokens.

```python
import asyncio
from petsseries import PetsSeriesClient

async def initialize_client():
    async with PetsSeriesClient() as client:
        await client.initialize()
        # Use the client for API calls

asyncio.run(initialize_client())
```
### Fetching Data
The client provides various methods to fetch data from the PetsSeries API.

#### Get User Info

meal_name = "Dinner"
portion_amount = 10  # 1 - 20 portions
feed_time = datetime.combine(datetime.today(), time(hour=18, minute=30))  # 6:30 PM
repeat_days = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  # Every day of the week

# Create a Meal instance
meal = Meal(
    id="",  # ID will be assigned by the server
    name=meal_name,
    portion_amount=portion_amount,
    feed_time=feed_time,
    repeat_days=repeat_days,
    device_id=device.id,
    enabled=True,
    url=""  # URL will be assigned by the server
)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while creating the meal: {e}")
```

#### Update Meal
```python
# Fetch homes
homes = await client.get_homes()
home = homes[0]  # Select the first home for example

# Fetch meals
meals = await client.get_meals(home)
meal_to_update = meals[0]  # Select the first meal for example

# Modify the meal details
meal_to_update.name = "Updated Meal Name"
meal_to_update.portion_amount = 3
meal_to_update.feed_time = time(13, 30)  # Update to 1:30 PM

# Update the meal
updated_meal = await client.update_meal(home, meal_to_update)
print(f"Meal updated: {updated_meal}")
```

### Home Management
The client provides a `HomesManager` for managing homes and home invitations. This supports sharing homes with family members.

# Rename an existing home
home = homes[0]
success = await client.homes_manager.rename_home(home, "Updated Home Name")
if success:
    print("Home renamed successfully!")
```

#### Delete a Home
```python
# Delete a home
success = await client.homes_manager.delete_home(home)
if success:
    print("Home deleted successfully!")
```

#### Home Invitations
Share your home with family members using invitations:

```python
from petsseries import HomeInviteRole

# Get all invites for a home
invites = await client.homes_manager.get_invites(home)
for invite in invites:
    print(f"Invite: {invite.email} - {invite.status.value}")

# Send a new invitation
success = await client.homes_manager.send_invite(
    home=home,
    email="family@example.com",
    label="Mom",
    role=HomeInviteRole.MEMBER  # or HomeInviteRole.ADMIN
)
if success:
    print("Invitation sent!")

# Resend an invitation
success = await client.homes_manager.resend_invite(home, invite_token)

# Update invite label
success = await client.homes_manager.update_invite_label(home, invite_token, "Dad")

# Delete/reject an invitation
success = await client.homes_manager.delete_invite(home, invite_token)
```

### Device Management
The client provides a `DevicesManager` for extended device operations.

#### Add a Device
```python
# Add a new device using product CTN
success = await client.devices_manager.add_device(home, product_ctn="PAW5320")
if success:
    print("Device added successfully!")
```

#### Rename a Device
```python
# Rename an existing device
device = devices[0]

settings = await client.devices_manager.get_device_settings(home, device)
if settings.filter_replacement_time:
    print(f"Filter replacement due: {settings.filter_replacement_time.value}")
if settings.feeder_voice_audio_id:
    print(f"Voice audio: {settings.feeder_voice_audio_id.audio_id}")
```

#### Update Device Settings
```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

# Update filter application time (reset filter timer)
success = await client.devices_manager.update_device_settings(
    home=home,
    device=device,
    filter_application_time=datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
)

# Or use the convenience method to reset the filter
success = await client.devices_manager.reset_filter(home, device)
```

### Discovery Service
The Discovery Service provides global configuration without requiring authentication.

```python
from petsseries import DiscoveryManager, get_discovery_config

# Quick method - get config without session management
config = await get_discovery_config()
print(f"API URL: {config.api_url}")
print(f"Consumer URL: {config.consumer_url}")

# Full method - with session management
async with DiscoveryManager() as discovery:
    config = await discovery.get_discovery_config()
    
    # Access country information
    for country in config.countries:
        print(f"{country.name} ({country.code})")
    
    # Check app version requirements
    if config.android_release:
        print(f"Android min version: {config.android_release.min_version}")
    if config.ios_release:
        print(f"iOS min version: {config.ios_release.min_version}")
```


You can manage device settings such as powering devices on/off and toggling motion notifications.

#### Device Power
```python
result = await client.power_on_device(home, device_id)
if result:
    print("Device powered on successfully.")

result = await client.power_off_device(home, device_id)
if result:
    print("Device powered off successfully.")

result = await client.toggle_device_power(home, device_id)
if result:
    print("Device power toggled successfully.")
```
#### Motion Notifications
```python
result = await client.enable_motion_notifications(home, device_id)
if result:
    print("Motion notifications enabled successfully.")

result = await client.disable_motion_notifications(home, device_id)
if result:
    print("Motion notifications disabled successfully.")

result = await client.toggle_motion_notifications(home, device_id)
if result:
    print("Motion notifications toggled successfully.")
```

### Example

            # Fetch devices in home
            devices = await client.get_devices(home)
            for device in devices:
                print(f"Device: {device.name} (ID: {device.id})")
                
                # Power off device
                success = await client.power_off_device(home, device.id)
                if success:
                    print(f"{device.name} powered off.")
                
                # Toggle motion notifications
                success = await client.toggle_motion_notifications(home, device.id)
                if success:

                from_date = dt.datetime(2021, 9, 27, tzinfo=dt.timezone(dt.timedelta(hours=2)))
                to_date = dt.datetime(2100, 9, 28, tzinfo=dt.timezone(dt.timedelta(hours=2)))
                print(from_date, to_date)

                events = await client.get_events(home, from_date, to_date)
                # Possible eventTypes are: ["motion_detected", "meal_dispensed", "meal_upcoming", "food_level_low"]
                for event in events:
                    if event.type == "meal_dispensed":
                        logger.info(f"Event: {event}")

#### Example Initialization with Tuya Features:

```python
    import asyncio
    from petsseries import PetsSeriesClient

    async def main():
        client = PetsSeriesClient(
            access_token="your_access_token_here",
            refresh_token="your_refresh_token_here",
            tuya_credentials={
                "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
                "ip": "DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS",
