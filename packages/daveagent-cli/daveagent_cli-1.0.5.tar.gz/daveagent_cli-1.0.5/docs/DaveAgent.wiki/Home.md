daveagent
```

### First Use

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd my-project

# Start CodeAgent
daveagent

# Search code before modifying
You: /search authentication system

# Mention specific files with @
You: @main.py fix the authentication bug in this file

# Or simply ask what you need
You: create a REST API with FastAPI for user management
```

## Use Cases

### Software Development
```bash
cd my-project
daveagent

# Search before modifying
You: /search current authentication system

# Mention specific files
You: @main.py fix the authentication bug
You: @config.py @.env update the API configuration

# Modify with context
You: create an authentication module with JWT
You: refactor the code in services/ to use async/await
```

### Data Analysis
```bash
cd data-project
daveagent

You: read the sales.csv file and show a summary
