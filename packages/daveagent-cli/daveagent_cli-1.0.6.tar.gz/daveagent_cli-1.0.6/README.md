```

### Internal Commands

Within DaveAgent, you can use these commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show command help |
| `/search <query>` | 🔍 Search and analyze code |
| `/index` | 🧠 Index project in vector memory |
| `/memory` | 📊 Show memory statistics |
| `@<file>` | 📎 Mention specific file with high priority |
| `/debug` | Enable/disable debug mode |
| `/logs` | Show logs location |
| `/stats` | Show statistics |
| `/clear` | Clear history |
| `/new` | New conversation |
| `/exit` | Exit DaveAgent |

#### 🔍 /search Command

The `/search` command invokes the **CodeSearcher** agent to search and analyze code:

```bash
You: /search authentication function
You: /search where is the TaskPlanner class used
You: /search how does the logging system work
```

**CodeSearcher provides you with:**
- 📍 Relevant files with exact locations
- 🔧 Functions found with complete code
- 📦 Important variables and constants
- 🔗 Dependencies between components
- 💡 Recommendations on what to modify

See [docs/CODESEARCHER_GUIDE.md](docs/CODESEARCHER_GUIDE.md) for more details.

#### 📎 File Mentions with @

Mention specific files in your query using `@`:

```bash
You: @main.py explain how this file works
You: @config.py @.env update the database connection settings
You: @src/agents/code_searcher.py add docstrings to all methods
```

## 📖 Examples

### Example 1: Use CodeSearcher before modifying

```bash
cd my-project
daveagent

# First, search for context
You: /search existing utilities system

# The agent shows functions, files and current structure
# Now modify with context

You: create a utils.py module with functions for:
    - validate email
    - format dates
    - calculate MD5 hash
```

DaveAgent first analyzes the existing code and then creates the `my-project/utils.py` file with the requested functions, avoiding duplicates and maintaining consistency.

### Example 2: Analyze a Project

```bash
cd existing-project
daveagent

You: analyze the project structure and give me a summary
You: how many functions are there in total?
You: find all files that use the requests library
```

### Example 3: Data Operations

```bash
cd data
daveagent

You: read the sales.csv file and show the top 10 sales
You: create a new CSV with only 2024 sales
You: convert the config.json file to CSV
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Key

DaveAgent uses DeepSeek by default. To change the model:

1. Edit `main.py`:
```python
self.model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
    model="gpt-4",  # Change here
    api_key="your-api-key",
    # ...
)
```

2. Or use environment variables in `.daveagent/.env`:
```bash
DAVEAGENT_API_KEY=your-api-key
DAVEAGENT_MODEL=gpt-4
DAVEAGENT_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
```

## 🧪 Evaluation with SWE-bench (Linux)

To evaluate the agent's performance using the **SWE-bench Verified** standard, we have included an automated script that works in Linux environments (or WSL2).

### Prerequisites
- Linux or WSL2 environment
- Docker installed and running (required for evaluation harness)
- Python 3.10+

### Execution

The `setup_and_run_linux.sh` script automates the entire process:
1. Compiles and installs the agent
2. Runs inference on 10 test tasks
3. Runs the official evaluation using Docker

```bash
# 1. Grant execution permissions
chmod +x setup_and_run_linux.sh

# 2. Run the script
./setup_and_run_linux.sh
```

**Note:** The complete evaluation may take time depending on your connection speed and CPU.
