## [1.0.8] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Agent Skills System**: Implemented a modular skills management system to enhance agent functionality. Introduced `SkillManager` for discovering, loading, and managing skills from directories, along with a `Skill` data model and parsing utilities for `SKILL.md` files (including YAML frontmatter and markdown body). Added validation for skill names and descriptions to ensure compliance with specifications.
- **Utility Tools**: Added a comprehensive suite of utility tools for file handling, JSON processing, web searching, and Wikipedia access. This includes `glob_tool.py` for efficient file searching with gitignore support, `json_tools.py` for reading, writing, merging, and validating JSON files, `read_file.py` with line range support, `search_file.py` for fuzzy file path searching, `search_tools.py` for regex pattern searching with git grep fallback, `web_search.py` for real-time searches using DuckDuckGo and Bing, `wikipedia_tools.py` for accessing Wikipedia content, and `write_file.py` for writing content with syntax checks and overwrite safeguards.
- **DeepSeek Reasoner Compatibility**: Added support for DeepSeek Reasoner models. Implemented `deepseek_fix.py` to manage `reasoning_content` and `deepseek_reasoning_client.py` to wrap `OpenAIChatCompletionClient`, enabling thinking mode and preserving reasoning content during tool calls to ensure compatibility with AutoGen and prevent token limit errors.
- **Langfuse Integration**: Integrated Langfuse with AutoGen for enhanced observability, including comprehensive documentation, authentication tests, event logging, multi-agent conversation tracing, and dashboard visibility validation.
- **State Management Tests**: Added comprehensive tests for AutoGen state management, covering basic save/load functionality, session continuation, history visualization, and multi-session management.
- **Dependencies**: Added `tiktoken>=0.5.0` dependency to support tokenization features.
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive wiki documentation including a `Tools-and-Features.md` detailing 50 integrated tools and a `Troubleshooting.md` guide.

### Changed
- **Filesystem Module Refactor**: Refactored the filesystem module by splitting operations (read, write, edit, delete, search) into dedicated files, implementing a facade pattern for better organization, and removing the obsolete `reapply_edit.py` file. Improved error handling and added detailed docstrings.
- **Code Refactoring**: Refactored code across multiple modules for improved readability and consistency. Simplified regex patterns in `parser.py` for YAML frontmatter and skill name validation, enhanced error handling and validation messages in skill parsing functions, streamlined approval prompts in various tools to reduce line breaks and improve clarity, and updated permission management for consistent formatting.
- **Type Hints and Imports**: Updated type hints across multiple modules to use modern syntax (`str | None`, `list[dict[str, Any]]`) for better clarity and Python 3.10+ compatibility. Removed unnecessary imports and organized existing ones for improved readability in files including `json_logger.py`, `llm_edit_fixer.py`, and `model_settings.py`.
- **CLI Update**: Updated the CLI interface to use AutoGen version 0.7 (from 0.4) and enhanced its display to show statistics and help in a more structured format using rich panels.
- **Logging and Output**: Improved logging and output formatting in `JSONLogger` and interaction utilities for better clarity. Enhanced logging messages in `logger.py` and `setup_wizard.py`.
- **Test Structure**: Cleaned up and improved test cases for better readability, consistency in assertions, and overall structure across files like `test_rag.py`, `test_skills.py`, and others.
- **README Cleanup**: Removed outdated sections from the README, including Data Analysis, Git Operations, and various feature descriptions.

### Fixed
- **Encoding Wrapper**: Added a wrapper script (`run_reports.py`) to run `generate_detailed_report.py` with UTF-8 encoding, resolving potential encoding issues on Windows systems.

### Removed
- **Obsolete Files**: Removed several obsolete files including `.agent_history` (outdated interactions), `demo_vibe_spinner.py`, `file_mentions_demo.md`, and `memory_usage_example.py`.
- **Wiki Upload Script**: Removed the wiki upload script as part of documentation updates.

### Performance
- **Code Style & Maintenance**: Performed widespread code cleanup to adhere to PEP 8 standards, including removing unnecessary blank lines, adjusting spacing, and cleaning up whitespace and formatting inconsistencies across the codebase. This improves maintainability and consistency.
