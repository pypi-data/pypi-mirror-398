# Scan Policy - Security Assessment Guidelines

## Overview

This document defines the scan policies and operational guidelines for the Security Scanner. The tool is designed to be **Non-intrusive** and **Ethical**, focusing on security assessment rather than exploitation.

## Scan Modes

### 🟢 Passive Mode (Default)

**Purpose:** Safe, non-intrusive observation of system behavior

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Observes normal responses
- ✅ Analyzes headers and configurations
- ✅ Checks for security best practices
- ✅ Does not send malicious inputs
- ✅ Does not change system state

**When to Use:**
- Production systems
- External assessments
- Initial reconnaissance
- Systems with limited authorization

**What It Checks:**
- Security headers presence
- Cookie security attributes
- Error message disclosure
- Server information leakage
- Response behavior patterns

**Risk Level:** ⭐ Very Low

---

### 🟡 Active-light Mode

**Purpose:** Controlled testing with safe inputs

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Sends controlled, expected inputs
- ✅ Tests logic behavior
- ✅ Observes inconsistencies
- ❌ Does not send malicious payloads
- ❌ Does not exploit vulnerabilities
- ❌ Does not brute force

**When to Use:**
- Staging environments
- Internal systems
- Systems with explicit authorization
- Development environments

**What It Checks:**
- Access control consistency
- Authentication logic
- Input validation presence
- IDOR vulnerabilities
- Session management

**Risk Level:** ⭐ Low (with proper authorization)

**Authorization Required:** ✅ Yes

## Policy Gates

### Authorization Check

Before running Active-light scans, the system verifies:

1. **Internal Flag** - Is this an internal system?
2. **Scan Policy** - Is active-light allowed?
3. **User Confirmation** - Has user acknowledged risks?

If authorization fails → **Forces Passive Mode**

### Rate Limiting

The scanner implements:

- **Request throttling** - Limits requests per second
- **Timeout controls** - Prevents hanging requests
- **Resource awareness** - Respects system limits

---

## What the Scanner Does NOT Do

### ❌ Exploitation
- Does not exploit vulnerabilities
- Does not attempt to gain unauthorized access
- Does not modify data

### ❌ Brute Force
- Does not attempt password guessing
- Does not enumerate accounts aggressively
- Does not overwhelm systems

### ❌ Payload Injection
- Does not send malicious payloads
- Does not attempt code execution
- Does not test destructive inputs

### ❌ State Changes
- Does not create accounts
- Does not modify configurations
- Does not delete data

---

## Scan Scope

### In-Scope (With Authorization)

✅ **Configuration Analysis**
- Security headers
- Cookie settings
- Server information

✅ **Behavior Observation**
- Response patterns
- Error handling
- Access control logic

✅ **Best Practice Validation**
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Security header presence
- Input validation presence

### Out-of-Scope

❌ **Exploitation**
❌ **Data Extraction**
❌ **System Modification**
❌ **Denial of Service**

## Operational Guidelines

### Pre-Scan Checklist

- [ ] Authorization obtained (written)
- [ ] Scan scope defined
- [ ] Target systems identified
- [ ] Scan mode selected
- [ ] Rate limits configured
- [ ] Contact information available

### During Scan

- Monitor scan progress
- Respect system resources
- Stop if issues detected
- Document findings

### Post-Scan

- Review findings
- Validate results
- Generate reports
- Share with authorized parties only

---

## Severity Classification

Findings are classified as:

- **Critical** - Immediate security risk
- **High** - Significant security concern
- **Medium** - Moderate security issue
- **Low** - Minor security observation

---

## Evidence Collection

The scanner collects evidence through:

1. **Response Observation** - Analyzes HTTP responses
2. **Pattern Matching** - Identifies security indicators
3. **Behavior Analysis** - Compares expected vs actual behavior
4. **Configuration Review** - Checks security settings

**All evidence is Non-intrusive** - No exploitation or data extraction.

---

## Compliance

This scanner aligns with:

- ✅ OWASP Testing Guide principles
- ✅ Ethical hacking guidelines
- ✅ Responsible disclosure practices
- ✅ Legal compliance requirements

---

## Reporting

Scan results include:

- **Summary** - Overview of findings
- **Findings** - Detailed security issues
- **Evidence** - Non-intrusive observations
- **Recommendations** - Remediation guidance
- **References** - Security standards

---

## Updates

This policy may be updated to reflect:

- New security standards
- Legal requirements
- Best practices
- Tool capabilities

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-22
