pip install willisapi_client
```

---

#### Getting a Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Log in to the Brooklyn Health web application.

3. Navigate to Personal Access Token (PAT) and copy it for use in the client.

---

#### Usage

**Upload**
To upload a CSV file:

```python
summary = willisapi.upload(key, '/path/to/data.csv')
```

How to Call the Function
- key: Your PAT token.
- data.csv: Path to your CSV file.

How to Reupload

If you need to reupload the same or updated file, simply call the upload function again:

```python
summary = willisapi.upload(key, 'data.csv', force_uploade=True)
```
---
#### Understanding Returned DataFrame and Errors

- The upload function returns a summary DataFrame containing the results of your upload.
- Columns typically include status, error messages, and metadata for each row in your CSV.
- If there are errors, they will be listed in the DataFrame under an error or message column.
- Review the DataFrame to identify and resolve any issues before reuploading.

---

#### CSV Validation Details

Before uploading, the client validates your CSV for:

- **Required Columns**: Must include study_id, site_id, participant_id, visit_name, visit_order, coa_name, coa_item_number, coa_item_value, file_path, time_collected.
- **Optional Columns**: rater_id, age, sex, race, language.
- **Valid COA Name**: Only these values are allowed: MADRS, YMRS, PHQ-9, GAD-7.
- **Valid Audio File**: The file path in each row must exist and be accessible.
- **Valid Data Types**: visit_order, age, coa_item_number, and coa_item_value must be numeric.
- **Language**: If present, must be in the allowed language choices.

If any validation fails, errors are collected and returned for review before upload proceeds.

---

**Processed Data Upload**

To upload a processed data CSV file:

```python
summary = willisapi.processed_upload(key, '/path/to/processed-data.csv')
```

How to Call the Function
- key: Your PAT token.
- processed-data.csv: Path to your processed data CSV file.
