This module extends `l10n_es_genci_account` to integrate GENCI functionality into the Sales workflow.

It automatically creates GENCI rate lines in sale orders when products subject to GENCI are added, and ensures correct transfer of GENCI amounts to customer invoices.

# Key Features

- "Apply GENCI" checkbox on sale orders to control GENCI application
- Automatic creation of GENCI lines based on product rules and quantities
- Consolidation of multiple products with the same rule into single GENCI lines
- Display of GENCI amounts on sale order reports (when enabled in company settings)
