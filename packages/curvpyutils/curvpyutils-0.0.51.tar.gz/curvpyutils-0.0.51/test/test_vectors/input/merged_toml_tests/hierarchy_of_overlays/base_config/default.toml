# Default configuration
#
# Instead of editing this file:
#  1. copy it to a new file in this dir (e.g., `profiles/my-config.toml`) and use `make CONFIG=my-config`
#  2. for per-directory overrides, e.g., in testbench dirs, create a `profiles/overrides.toml` 
#      in that dir. These overrides will apply regardless of the currently selected config.
#
# See docs/config.md for more details about how this infegrates into the build process.
