"""Power Pet Door simulator submodule.

This module provides a simulated Power Pet Door that speaks the same
protocol as the real device. Useful for testing clients without
real hardware.

The simulator can:
- Respond to all client commands
- Spontaneously trigger events (sensor triggers, door movements)
- Simulate realistic door open/close sequences with configurable timing
- Simulate obstruction detection and auto-retract
- Simulate pet presence keeping door open
- Store and retrieve schedules
- Be controlled interactively via keyboard or programmatically

Example usage:
    # Run interactively
    python -m powerpetdoor.simulator

    # Or use programmatically
    from powerpetdoor.simulator import DoorSimulator
    simulator = DoorSimulator(port=3000)
    await simulator.start()
