# ProcrastiMate.io

> Professional-grade procrastination, engineered.

ProcrastiMate is a satirical CLI tool that helps you **delay tasks responsibly** by:
- detecting vague tasks
- generating realistic corporate excuses
- rescheduling work in a believable way

This is **not** a productivity tool.  
It is a *plausibility engine*.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Detects vague vs clear tasks using heuristics
- 💬 Generates realistic, manager-safe excuses
- 🗓 Suggests plausible new deadlines
- 🖥 Clean CLI interface
- 🔍 Deterministic & explainable (no random LLM chaos)

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install procrastimate
```

## 🚀 Usage
```
procrastimate "enable QR for subs flow" --severity high
```
### Example output
```
🕒 ProcrastiMate Decision

Task      : enable QR for subs flow
Vague     : Yes
Excuse    : We need to ensure cross-functional alignment and clarify ownership before moving forward.
New Date  : 2025-12-31
```
### ⚙️ CLI Options

#### Flag	Description	Default
```
--severity	Task urgency: low, medium, high	medium
--audience	Target audience: manager, client, self	manager
```


### 🧠 How It Works

The task is analyzed for vagueness using keyword-based heuristics

An excuse template is selected based on:

1. task clarity
2. severity
3. audience

**A new date is suggested based on plausibility, not efficiency**

No calendars.
No optimization.
No accountability.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is satire.

Do not use ProcrastiMate to:

- deceive clients
- avoid responsibilities
- justify bad engineering decisions
  
(But also… I know you will.)
