Export notebooks with folded code cells hidden. Perfect for sharing clean notebooks with non-technical audiences - fold code, save, and export to HTML or PDF without visible code.

## Features

- **Export with Hidden Code** - Folded code cells are automatically hidden when exporting to HTML, PDF, and other formats
- **Fold/Expand All** - Commands available in the View menu to fold or expand all code cells at once

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To export a notebook with folded code cells hidden, you must **save the notebook first**. The export reads the saved file, so unsaved changes will not be reflected in the exported document.

## Installation

Requires JupyterLab 4.0.0 or higher.

```bash
pip install jupyterlab_fold_all_code_extension
```

## Uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab_fold_all_code_extension
```
