## Core Philosophy

**You don't know it until you model it.**

## The Five Steps of Modeling

Modeling is the process of cognition, consisting of five progressive steps:

1. **Recognize**: Delivers a **Boolean**.
   - Acknowledging the existence of a concept or entity.
2. **Name**: Delivers a **String**.
   - Assigning a unique reference name to the concept.
3. **Describe**: Delivers a **Hierarchical List**.
   - Listing attributes, characteristics, and relationships with other concepts.
4. **Schematize**: Delivers a **Pydantic Model** (or other Schema).
   - Translating the description into a strict structure understandable by computers.
5. **Normalize**: Delivers **Validator & Test Assertion**.
   - Defining validation logic and test assertions to ensure data meets expected constraints.

## Vision: Da Vinci in the AI Era

Due to the specialization of the industrial age, humans often handle only one or two steps in this chain. Product managers describe, architects schematize, and developers normalize.

**The emergence of AI enables everyone to bridge the entire chain and become a polymath (Da Vinci).**

However, existing toolchains fragment this process, breaking the flow:

- Mind mapping in XMind
- Documentation in Word/Notion
- Coding in IDEs

**Typedown Proposes**:

Future humans should work in a **unified format that smoothly supports the transition from recognition to normalization, from Idea to production-grade code**.

In this format, we leave the drudgery of **casting thought into form** to AI, while humans focus on the core creative thinking.
