# 0001. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-12-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made during the development of Typedown to ensure consistency, facilitate onboarding of new contributors, and provide a history of the "why" behind the code.


## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural changes. We will follow a lightweight format similar to [Michael Nygard's template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

Each ADR will reside in `dev-docs/adr/` and follow the naming convention `NNNN-title-in-kebab-case.md`.

## Consequences

*   We will have a clear history of design choices.
*   Discussions will be captured in a structured format rather than lost in chat logs.
*   Writing ADRs requires a small amount of extra effort but pays off in long-term maintainability.
