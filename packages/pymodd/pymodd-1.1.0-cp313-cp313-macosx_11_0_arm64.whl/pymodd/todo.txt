COMPILING


- SO finish refactoring, no more circular imports PLS

- it would be nice to move default json file to somewhere else (like storage)


GENERATION

- everything got kinda funny after the changes, need to fix imports for pymodd projects
  - DataType in game_variables.py is not in pymodd.variable.data_type
  - pymodd.function import needs to be changed to pymodd.functions
  
- it would be nice to change utils folder name to storage (would neeed to u[pdate docs)
