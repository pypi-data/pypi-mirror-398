**Capeify**

pip install capeify
```

# How to use it
To convert a Windows cursor pack , run :
```
capeify convert --path PATH/TO/THE/CURSORPACK --inf-file INF_FILE_NAME --out OUT_FILE_PATH
```

# How it works
The program first parses the INF file and reads the [Strings],[AddReg] etc. entries and gets the cursor names and their corresponding cur/ani files,
after that those cur/ani files are parsed and their hotspot position,frame duration,frame count etc. are saved and they're converted to pngs, also the cursor names are translated into MacOS cursor identifiers.

After that a ready cape file template is filled with those data and its ready to use.

# Contributing
To contribute to this project, create issues telling me if there are any problems like if a Win cursor name is translated into the wrong MacOS identifier or if a identifier is missing,if a cursors hotspot is wrong etc.

Also you can recommend features to contribute and further develop this project.
