    StreamReader is an abstract base class that defines the structure for creating a stream reader
    that can read data from a specific transport mechanism in a background thread.

    This class is designed to be subclassed, where the subclass provides specific implementations
    of the methods to read from and close the underlying data transport. The StreamReader class
    handles the queuing of read data and provides thread-safe access to this data if queue_size > 0.
