# Bigraph-Schema

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bigraph-schema.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/bigraph-schema/)
[![Tutorial](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Pages-Tutorial-brightgreen)](https://vivarium-collective.github.io/bigraph-schema/notebooks/demo.html)

`bigraph-schema` provides a serializable type schema for compositional and multiscale modeling.  
It defines a compact, extensible language for describing hierarchical data structures — the foundation of the Vivarium 2.0 simulation framework.

The library offers a unified interface for representing, validating, and transforming schemas and data in structured simulations.  
By standardizing schema definitions, it enables interoperability between models, extensibility across frameworks, and reproducibility of computational experiments.
