"""Merge local coverage.xml files under a directory and print a percentage.

Usage: merge_local_coverage.py [artifacts_dir]

Prints either a percentage like "85%" or the string "unknown".

This script properly merges coverage from multiple coverage.xml files by tracking
which lines are covered in each source file across all reports, avoiding double-counting.
