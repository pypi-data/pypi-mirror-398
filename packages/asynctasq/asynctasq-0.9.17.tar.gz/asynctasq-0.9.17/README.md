## Quick Start

Get started in 60 seconds:

```bash
# Install AsyncTasQ (Python 3.12+ required)
uv add asynctasq[redis]
```

```python
import asyncio

import asynctasq
from asynctasq.tasks import task

# 1. Configure AsyncTasQ
asynctasq.init(driver="redis", redis_url="redis://localhost:6379")


# 2. Define a task
@task
async def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):
    print(f"Sending email to {to}: {subject}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate email sending
    return f"Email sent to {to}"


# 3. Dispatch the task
async def main():
    for i in range(10):
        task_id = await send_email(
            to=f"user{i}@example.com", subject=f"Welcome {i}!", body="Welcome to our platform!"
        ).dispatch()
        print(f"Task dispatched: {task_id}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Note: this uses uvloop (via asynctasq.utils.loop.run) for best performance
    from asynctasq.utils.loop import run as uv_run

    uv_run(main())

```

```bash
# Run the worker (in a separate terminal)
python -m asynctasq worker
```

**That's it!** Your first AsyncTasQ is ready. Now let's explore the powerful features.

## Why AsyncTasQ?

### True Async-First Architecture

Unlike Celery and RQ which are built on synchronous foundations, AsyncTasQ is **designed from the ground up for asyncio**:

- **Native async/await everywhere** – All core operations use asyncio, no threading or blocking on critical paths
- **Multiple execution modes** – Choose between async I/O (event loop), sync I/O (thread pool), or CPU-bound (process pool) for each task
- **High-performance concurrency** – Process hundreds of tasks concurrently with minimal overhead using asyncio's efficient task scheduling
- **Smart connection pooling** – All drivers use connection pools optimized for async operations
- **Non-blocking by design** – Worker polling, task execution, and all I/O operations are truly non-blocking
- **uvloop-powered event loop** – AsyncTasQ prefers `uvloop` for production workloads; the project provides a small helper (`asynctasq.utils.loop.run`) that creates and runs a uvloop-based event loop for CLI and short-lived run paths.

### Intelligent Serialization & ORM Integration

- **msgpack binary encoding** – 2-3x faster than JSON with smaller payloads
- **Automatic ORM model handling** – Pass SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or Tortoise ORM models directly as task arguments. AsyncTasQ automatically:
  - Serializes them as lightweight references (primary key only)
  - Reduces payload size by 90%+
  - Re-fetches with fresh data when the task executes
  - Supports all 3 major Python ORMs out of the box
- **Smart type handling** – Native support for `datetime`, `Decimal`, `UUID`, `set`, and custom types without manual conversion

### Enterprise-Grade Reliability

- **ACID guarantees** – PostgreSQL and MySQL drivers provide transactional dequeue with exactly-once processing semantics
- **Built-in dead-letter queues** – PostgreSQL/MySQL drivers automatically move permanently failed tasks to DLQ for inspection
- **Crash recovery** – Visibility timeouts ensure no task is lost even if workers crash mid-execution
- **Graceful shutdown** – SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers drain in-flight tasks before stopping (configurable timeout)
- **Flexible retry strategies** – Per-task retry configuration with custom `should_retry()` hooks for intelligent retry logic
- **Task timeout protection** – Prevent runaway tasks with configurable per-task timeouts
- **Real-time observability** – Redis Pub/Sub event streaming broadcasts task lifecycle events for monitoring dashboards

### Developer Experience That Just Works

- **Elegant, Laravel-inspired API** – Clean, intuitive syntax that feels natural
- **Full type safety** – Complete type hints, mypy/pyright compatible, Generic `Task[T]` for return type checking
- **Simple configuration** – Use `asynctasq.init()` and `Config.get()` for all configuration needs
- **Two task styles** – Choose function-based `@task` decorators or class-based tasks with lifecycle hooks
- **Fluent method chaining** – Configure tasks expressively: `.delay(60).on_queue("high").retry_after(120).dispatch()`
- **First-class FastAPI integration** – Lifespan management, automatic connection pooling, native async support

### Multi-Driver Flexibility Without Vendor Lock-In

- **5 production-ready drivers** – Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS – all with the same API
- **Switch with one line** – Change `driver="redis"` to `driver="postgres"` – no code changes needed
- **Per-task driver override** – Use Redis for high-throughput tasks, PostgreSQL for ACID-critical tasks in the same application
- **Same API, different guarantees** – Choose the driver that matches your SLA requirements without rewriting code

11. **Optional monitoring UI** – Beautiful real-time dashboard via [asynctasq-monitor](https://github.com/adamrefaey/asynctasq-monitor)
12. **Elegant, Laravel-inspired API** – Method chaining (`.delay(60).on_queue("high").dispatch()`) and intuitive task definitions
13. **Simple configuration** – Use `asynctasq.init()` and `Config.get()` for all configuration needs

## Quick Reference

- **One-line setup:** `just init` — install deps and pre-commit hooks
- **Start services:** `just services-up` — Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, RabbitMQ, LocalStack (SQS) for local integration tests
- **Run tests:** `just test` (or `pytest`) — use `just test-unit` / `just test-integration` to scope
- **Run with coverage:** `just test-cov` or `pytest --cov=src/asynctasq --cov-report=html`
- **Run the worker locally:** `python -m asynctasq worker`
- **Pre-commit hooks:** [`./setup-pre-commit.sh`](https://github.com/adamrefaey/asynctasq/blob/main/setup-pre-commit.sh) or `just setup-hooks`
- **Format / lint / typecheck:** `just format`, `just lint`, `just typecheck`

## CI & Contributing (short)

- **CI runs on PRs and pushes to `main`** and includes lint, type checks and tests across Python 3.12–3.14.
- **Pre-commit hooks** enforce formatting and static checks locally before commits (see [`./setup-pre-commit.sh`](https://github.com/adamrefaey/asynctasq/blob/main/setup-pre-commit.sh)).
- **Branch protection:** enable required status checks (CI success, lint, unit/integration jobs) for `main`.
- **Coverage badge:** the repository updates `.github/coverage.svg` automatically via `.github/workflows/coverage-badge.yml`.
- **Run full CI locally:** `just ci` (runs format/lint/typecheck/tests like the workflow).
