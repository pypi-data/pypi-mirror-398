    Reads an A3M file and returns sequences as a numpy array, along with insertion positions and taxonomy IDs.
    A3M files differ from A2M files in that dots (".") are discarded for compactness; thus, lines may be different lengths (but we still have the same number of aligned columns).

    While parsing:
        - Keep track of number of insertions to the LEFT of each position.
        - Keep track of taxonomy IDs to support MSA pairing downstream.

    NOTE: Files must contain only ASCII characters; we do not handle Unicode characters.

        filename (str or Path): The path to the A3M file, can be gzipped.
        maxseq (int): The maximum number of sequences to read from the file (for processing speed). Passed from the associated Transform.
