# ILLUSION: Agentic Programming Assistant

ILLUSION is a CLI-based agentic programming assistant is meant to mainly help Termux users expericence no hands programmming to create and manage projects using AI-powered code generation via OpenRouter.

## Features

- Flexible model support: Use any model available on OpenRouter
- Project-based workflow: Create and manage multiple projects
- Full project context awareness: LLM sees current file contents for precise updates
- Memory management: Tracks project history without hallucinations
- Cross-platform: Works on Termux, Linux, and Windows
- Git integration: Automatic version control for projects
- Sensible file organization: Projects created in current directory

## Installation

### Fast (Recommended):
1. Run `pip install illusion-cli` to install Illusion as a python pacakge

### OR (WHEN source files get released on my official github page)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install openai rich`
3. Create `config.py` with your OpenRouter API key and preferred model

## Configuration

### For Fast Method (Recomended):
1. Run `illusion config` in your terminal
2. Paste your OpenRouter API key
3. Paste your choise of modle e.g. "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"
4. Leave Provider as OpenRouter

### OR (WHEN source files get released on my official github page)

Create a `config.py` file in the same directory as `illusion.py`:

```python
# ILLUSION Configuration File
# Paste your OpenRouter API key here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"

# Choose the model you want to use (e.g., "deepseek/deepseek-r1:free", "anthropic/claude-3-haiku", etc.)
MODEL = "deepseek/deepseek-r1:free"

# LLM Provider (currently only openrouter is supported)
LLM_PROVIDER = "openrouter"
```

## Usage

### For Fast Method (Recomended):
1. Run `illusion` in your terminal - ensure configuration file is set

### OR (WHEN source files get released on my official github page):
Run the application:

```bash
python illusion.py
```

### Commands

- `np <project_name> e.g. np my_project`: Create a new project
- `op <project_name>`: Open an existing project
- `config OR illusion config`: View current configuration
- `illusion`: Enter chat interface for the active project
- `help`: Show help menu
- `exit`: Exit the application

### In Chat Interface

Describe what you want to build, and ILLUSION will generate the code. For example:

- "Create a simple HTML page with a button"
- "Add a Python script to calculate fibonacci numbers"
- "Make the button change color when clicked"

ILLUSION will create files in the `src/` directory and can execute Python and shell scripts with user approval ofcourse.

## Project Structure

Projects are created in the current working directory:

```
my_project/
├── .illusion/
│   ├── chat_history.json
│   └── vector.db
├── src/
│   └── (generated files)
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── .git/
```

## Cross-Platform Notes
- On Windows, projects are saved in `Users/<user_name>/Illusions`path
- On Linux or Termux, projects are saved in `~Illusions` at home directory

### OR (WHEN source files get released on my official github page)
- On Windows, uses `python` instead of `python3`
- On Windows, shell scripts use `cmd` instead of `bash`
- Logs are written to `%TEMP%\illusion.log` on Windows, `/tmp/illusion.log` on Unix-like systems

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenRouter API key
- Git (optional, for version control)
- Termux `proot-distro` if you are using Termux `login debian` or any other distro of your choise (Recommeneded to allow quick and easy installation of PC native pacakages like OpenAI wrapper)
- Internet connection for API calls
