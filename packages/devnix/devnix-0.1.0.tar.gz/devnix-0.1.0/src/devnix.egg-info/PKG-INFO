**Devnix** is a high-performance, zero-config CLI companion for Python developers. It automates repetitive tasks, enforces security standards, and ensures your environment is always healthy—letting you focus on writing code, not configuring it.

---

## Why Devnix?

Modern Python development often feels like juggling: managing `.env` files, checking ports, running different server commands for different frameworks, and remembering to format code. 

**Devnix replaces that mental load with a single, intelligent tool.**

*   **Zero Configuration**: Drop into any project and run `devnix run`. It just works.
*   **Safety First**: Automatically detects exposed secrets and unsafe production settings.
*   **Framework Aware**: Tailors its behavior perfectly for Django, FastAPI, Flask, and more.
*   **Beautiful UI**: Clean, ASCII-only terminal output designed for maximum compatibility and clarity.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in seconds.

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install devnix
```

### 2. Basic Usage

Navigate to your project folder and let Devnix take care of the rest:

```bash
devnix run      # Detects framework and starts the server
devnix doctor   # Comprehensive health and security check
devnix check    # Run tests, formatters, and linters in one go
```

## 🛠️ Core Commands

### `devnix run`
**The "Just Work" Command.**
Devnix identifies your framework and launches the appropriate dev server while automatically loading your `.env` variables and verifying that your ports are free.

### `devnix doctor`
**Your Personal Health Inspector.**
Performs a deep-scan of your project and environment:
- **Environment**: Verifies Python versions and Virtual Environments.
- **Security**: Scans for `DEBUG=True` in production and searches for committed secrets in Git.
- **Dependencies**: Checks for missing `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.
- **Infrastructure**: Identifies port conflicts before they crash your app.

### `devnix check`
**The Continuous Integration Powerhouse.**
Ensures your code is production-ready by running the full stack: `pytest` → `black` → `isort` → `flake8`. It stops at the first sign of trouble, forcing a perfect code state.

### `devnix info`
**Quick Metadata Viewer.**
Instantly see your project type (Django, Flask, etc.), current working directory, and the installed Devnix version.

### `devnix clean`
**Reset Your Workspace.**
Instantly purges `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, and other junk files that clutter your project.

### `devnix env`
**Secure Variable Management.**
- `devnix env check`: Compares `.env` to `.env.example` to ensure no variables are missing.
- `devnix env generate`: Creates a clean `.env.example` while automatically stripping sensitive values.

## 🔍 Smart Framework Detection

Devnix understands your project structure better than you do.

| Framework | Detection Signature | Primary Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Django** | `manage.py` | `runserver` |
| **FastAPI** | `FastAPI` instance in code | `uvicorn` |
| **Flask** | `Flask` dependencies | `flask run` |
| **Script** | `main.py` | `python main.py` |
| **Package** | `pyproject.toml` | Environment setup |
