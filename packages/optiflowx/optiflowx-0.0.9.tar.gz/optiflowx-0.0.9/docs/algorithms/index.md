# Algorithms

This section collects the optimization algorithms implemented or discussed in OptiFlowX. Each algorithm page provides a short overview, quick facts, common parameters and a small usage example showing how to call the optimizer from the library.

Jump to a specific algorithm:

- [Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)](./pso)
- [Simulated Annealing (SA)](./simulated-annealing)
- [Bayesian Optimization](./bayesian-optimization)
- [Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)](./tpe)
- [Random Search](./random-search)
- [Grid Search](./grid-search)
- [Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)](./grey-wolf-optimization)
- [Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)](./ant-colony-optimization)

If you'd like the algorithms presented as cards or include short comparisons (complexity / recommended uses), tell me and I will add a polished comparison table or card-layout index.
