## Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

ACO is a pheromone-based swarm intelligence algorithm used to solve path and combinatorial optimization problems by simulating ant foraging behaviour.

### Steps (compact)
1. Construct solutions stochastically
2. Update pheromone trails
3. Evaporate pheromones (avoid stagnation)
4. Repeat until termination

### Variants
- Ant System (AS)
- Ant Colony System (ACS)
- Max-Min Ant System (MMAS)

### Pros / Cons
- Pros: effective on graph-based problems
- Cons: parameter-sensitive, speciality tuning often required
