"""
Empirical False Positive Rate (FPR) validation tests for abloom.

These tests verify that the BloomFilter maintains an empirical FPR at or below
the target rate (within a tolerance). Uses simple threshold-based assertions
rather than statistical testing for simplicity.

Test approach:
1. Insert `capacity` distinct integers into the filter
2. Probe `probe_count` distinct integers NOT in the filter
3. Measure empirical FPR = false_positives / probe_count
4. Assert empirical FPR <= target_fpr * TOLERANCE_MULTIPLIER

Note: Uses sequential integers intentionally. This tests proper hash distribution
via the mix64 finalizer, which is critical for small integers where Python's
hash(n) == n. Without mix64, sequential integers would all map to the same
block, causing 100% FPR.
