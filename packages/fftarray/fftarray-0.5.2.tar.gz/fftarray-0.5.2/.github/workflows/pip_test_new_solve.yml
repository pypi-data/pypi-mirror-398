# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a single version of Python
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
# This workflow solves the required dependencies when it runs with the then current state of pypi.
# This ensures that an installation still works with the current state of package registries.
