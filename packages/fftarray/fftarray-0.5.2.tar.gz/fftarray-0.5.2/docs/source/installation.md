# Installation

The required dependencies of FFTArray are kept small to ensure compatibility with many different environments.
For most use cases we recommend installing the optional constraint solver with the `dimsolver` option:
```shell
pip install fftarray[dimsolver]
```

Any array library besides NumPy like for example [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) should be installed following their respective documentation.
