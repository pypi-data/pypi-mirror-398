Sphinx DataTables
=================

This extension makes it easy to use more expressive tables in Sphinx documentation with `DataTables <https://datatables.net/>`__.
See the demo and full documentation `online <https://sharm294.github.io/sphinx-datatables/>`__.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: console

    pip install sphinx-datatables

Usage
-----

Add the extension in your ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    extensions = [
        "sphinxcontrib.jquery",
        "sphinx_datatables",
    ]

In your ``.rst`` documentation, create a table and add a custom class label.
Your table must have a valid header row.

.. code-block:: rst

    .. csv-table::
        :header: First Name,Last Name
        :class: sphinx-datatable

        John,Smith
        Jane,Doe

``DataTables`` provides many `options <https://datatables.net/reference/option>`__ that can be tweaked at its configuration.
These can be configured for all tables using the ``datatables_options`` variable in ``conf.py``.

.. note::
    By using ``DataTables`` you are introducing many features that will have side-effects on the resulting HTML live rendering (as it is JavaScript based).
    So please, bear in mind that ``Sphinx`` features or your custom styles may not be compatible with it.

Configuration
-------------

The following configuration options are available with the following default values:

.. code-block:: python

    # in conf.py

    # set the version to use for DataTables plugin
    datatables_version = "2.3.5"

    # name of the class to use for tables to enable DataTables
    datatables_class = "sphinx-datatable"

    # any custom options to pass to the DataTables constructor. Note that any
    # options you set are used for all DataTables.
    datatables_options = {}

    # custom remote URLs (or offline path in html_static_paths) for ...
    ## datatables.min.js
    datatables_js = ""
    ## datatables.min.css
    datatables_css = ""
