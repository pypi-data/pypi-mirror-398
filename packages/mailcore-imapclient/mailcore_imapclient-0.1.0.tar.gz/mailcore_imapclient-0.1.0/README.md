# mailcore-imapclient

**IMAPClient adapter for [mailcore](https://github.com/mailreactor/mailcore)** - wraps synchronous IMAPClient with async executor pattern for BSD-3 licensed IMAP support.

This adapter enables mailcore to work with IMAPClient, providing a commercial-friendly (BSD-3) alternative to GPL-licensed IMAP libraries. For a native async GPL-3 licensed alternative, see [mailcore-aioimaplib](https://github.com/mailreactor/mailcore-aioimaplib).

## Installation

```bash
pip install mailcore mailcore-imapclient
```
