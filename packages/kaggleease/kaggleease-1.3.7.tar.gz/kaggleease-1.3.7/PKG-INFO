# KaggleEase

The fastest, notebook-first way to load Kaggle datasets into pandas with one line.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/)

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install kaggleease
```

## Quick Start

```python
from kaggleease import load
# Intelligent handle resolution - searches and finds 'kaggle/titanic' for you
df = load("titanic") 
```

## ✨ New in v1.3.0: Intelligent Loader
KaggleEase is now "Intelligent." It doesn't just fail; it helps you fix your mistakes.

- **Fuzzy Handle Matching**: Made a typo? `load("titanik")` will suggest `titanic`.
- **Implicit Slugs**: No need for owners. `load("housing")` finds the most relevant dataset.
- **Actionable Errors**: In notebooks, errors appear as clean Markdown blocks with **💡 Fix Suggestions**.
- **Zero-Dependency REST**: Purged the heavy `kaggle` library (~10MB) for a lightweight 50KB core.

## Usage in Google Colab

### 1. Install the package
In a Colab cell, run:
```python
!pip install kaggleease
```

### 2. Use the module
```python
from kaggleease import load

df = load("titanic")
print(df.head())
```

### 3. Magic commands in Colab
```python
# Load dataset into a variable named 'df'
%kaggle load titanic --as df

# Preview a dataset
%kaggle preview titanic

# Search for datasets
%kaggle search "credit risk"
```

## Usage in Local Jupyter Notebooks

### 1. Install the package
```bash
pip install kaggleease
```

### 2. Set up Kaggle credentials
- Go to https://www.kaggle.com/account
- Download your `kaggle.json` file
- Place it in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.kaggle\kaggle.json` on Windows)
- Set file permissions to 600 (read/write for owner only)

### 3. Use the module
```python
from kaggleease import load

df = load("titanic")
print(df.head())
```

### 4. Magic commands in Jupyter
```python
# Load dataset into a specific variable
%kaggle load titanic --as df

# Preview dataset
%kaggle preview titanic

# Search for datasets
%kaggle search "credit risk"
```

## Advanced Features

### Progress Indication
Large downloads show progress bars automatically:
```python
from kaggleease import load
df = load("large-dataset", timeout=600)  # Progress shown for large files
```

### Thread-Safe Authentication
Multiple concurrent operations are supported safely:
```python
import threading
from kaggleease import load

def load_dataset(dataset):
    return load(dataset)

# Safe to run concurrently
threads = [threading.Thread(target=lambda: load_dataset("dataset")) for _ in range(5)]
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()
```

### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
Network failures are automatically retried:
- First retry after 1s
- Second retry after 2s
- Third retry after 4s

## Notebook Magic

`KaggleEase` comes with powerful notebook magics:

```python
# Load the titanic dataset into a variable named 'df'
%kaggle load titanic --as df --timeout 600

# Preview the first few rows of a dataset
%kaggle preview titanic --timeout 30

# Search for datasets
%kaggle search "credit risk" --timeout 30

# Load specific file from dataset
%kaggle load kaggle/titanic --file train.csv --as train_df
```

## Command Line Interface

KaggleEase provides a comprehensive CLI:

```bash
# Load a dataset with custom timeout
kaggleease load kaggle/titanic --timeout 600

# Preview a dataset
kaggleease preview kaggle/titanic

# Search for datasets with result limit
kaggleease search "credit risk" --top 10

# Load specific file from dataset
kaggleease load kaggle/titanic --file train.csv

# 🚀 NEW: Setup shell completion
kaggleease completion --shell zsh # or bash/fish
```

## API Reference

### `load(dataset_handle, file=None, timeout=300)`

Load a Kaggle dataset into a pandas DataFrame with automatic progress indication for large files.

**Parameters:**
- `dataset_handle` (str): The Kaggle dataset handle in the format "owner/dataset-name"
- `file` (str, optional): Specific file to load from the dataset
- `timeout` (int): Timeout in seconds for API calls and downloads (default: 300)

**Returns:**
- `pandas.DataFrame`: The loaded dataset

**Features:**
- Automatic progress indication for files > 100MB
- Thread-safe authentication
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Structured logging

### `search(query, top=5, timeout=30)`

Search for Kaggle datasets.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (str): Search query
- `top` (int): Maximum number of results to return (default: 5)
- `timeout` (int): Timeout in seconds for the search operation (default: 30)

**Returns:**
- `list`: List of dataset information dictionaries

### `ProgressBar` and `show_progress`

Progress indication utilities for large downloads:
```python
from kaggleease.progress import ProgressBar

progress = ProgressBar(1000, "Download")
progress.update(500)  # Update with downloaded bytes
progress.complete()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Error
If you encounter authentication errors, make sure you have your Kaggle API credentials set up:

1. Go to https://www.kaggle.com/account and download your `kaggle.json` file
2. Place it in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.kaggle\kaggle.json` on Windows)
3. Ensure the file has restricted permissions (600)

### Large Dataset Warning
When loading large datasets (>5GB), you'll see a warning. Consider if you really need the entire dataset or if you can work with a subset.

### Timeout Errors
If you're experiencing timeout errors, try increasing the timeout value:
```python
# Increase timeout to 600 seconds
df = load("titanic", timeout=600)
```

### Progress Indication
For large downloads, progress is shown automatically. For manual control:
```python
from kaggleease.progress import show_progress
progress = show_progress(250, 1000, "Download")  # 250 bytes of 1000 total
```

### Thread Safety
The library is thread-safe for concurrent operations. Multiple threads can safely call `load()` simultaneously.

## Security Considerations

- Authentication credentials are stored securely with proper file permissions (600)
- Thread-safe authentication prevents credential corruption in concurrent environments
- All network operations include timeout protection
