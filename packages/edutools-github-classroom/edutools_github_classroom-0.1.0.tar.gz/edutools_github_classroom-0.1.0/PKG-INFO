A Python library for interacting with the GitHub Classroom REST API. This package provides a clean, Pythonic interface to manage classrooms, assignments, submissions, and grades.

## Features

- 🎓 **Classroom Management**: List, filter, and manage GitHub Classrooms
- 📚 **Assignment Operations**: Create, list, and filter assignments
- 📝 **Submission Tracking**: Monitor student submissions and progress
- 🎯 **Grade Management**: Retrieve and export grades
- 🔒 **Authentication**: Support for GitHub personal access tokens
- 📊 **Statistics**: Built-in analytics for assignments and submissions
- 🚀 **Easy to Use**: Simple, intuitive API design
- 🔄 **Auto-pagination**: Automatic handling of paginated responses

## Installation

```bash
pip install edutools-github-classroom
```

## Quick Start

```python
from edutools_github_classroom import ClassroomAPI

# Initialize the API client with your GitHub token
api = ClassroomAPI("ghp_your_token_here")

# List all your classrooms
classrooms = api.classrooms.get_all()
for classroom in classrooms:
    print(f"{classroom['name']} (ID: {classroom['id']})")

# Filter classrooms by name
iir_classrooms = api.classrooms.filter_by_name("iir5g")

# Get assignments for a classroom
assignments = api.assignments.get_all(classroom_id=12345)

# Filter assignments (e.g., exclude projects)
ateliers = api.assignments.filter_by_title(
    classroom_id=12345,
    title_pattern="projet",
    exclude=True
)

# Get submissions for an assignment
submissions = api.submissions.get_all(assignment_id=67890)

# Get grades and export to CSV
grades = api.grades.get(assignment_id=67890)
api.grades.export_to_csv(67890, "grades.csv")

# Get statistics
stats = api.assignments.get_statistics(67890)
print(f"Pass rate: {stats['pass_rate']}%")
```

## Authentication

You need a GitHub personal access token to use this library. The token doesn't require any specific permissions for public resources.

### Creating a Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token (classic or fine-grained)
3. For public classrooms, no special permissions are needed
4. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_` for classic or `github_pat_` for fine-grained)

### Using the Token

```python
from edutools_github_classroom import ClassroomAPI

# Direct initialization
api = ClassroomAPI("ghp_your_token_here")

# Using environment variable (recommended)
import os
token = os.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
api = ClassroomAPI(token)

# Using context manager (auto-cleanup)
with ClassroomAPI(token) as api:
    classrooms = api.classrooms.get_all()
```

## API Documentation

### Classrooms

```python
# List classrooms with pagination
classrooms = api.classrooms.list(page=1, per_page=30)

# Get a specific classroom
classroom = api.classrooms.get(classroom_id=12345)

# Get all classrooms (auto-pagination)
all_classrooms = api.classrooms.get_all()

# Filter by name pattern
iir_classrooms = api.classrooms.filter_by_name("iir5g", case_sensitive=False)

# Get only active (non-archived) classrooms
active = api.classrooms.filter_active()
```

### Assignments

```python
# List assignments for a classroom
assignments = api.assignments.list(classroom_id=12345, per_page=50)

# Get a specific assignment
assignment = api.assignments.get(assignment_id=67890)

# Get all assignments (auto-pagination)
all_assignments = api.assignments.get_all(classroom_id=12345)

# Filter assignments by title
ateliers = api.assignments.filter_by_title(
    classroom_id=12345,
    title_pattern="atelier"
)

# Exclude assignments (e.g., projects)
no_projects = api.assignments.filter_by_title(
    classroom_id=12345,
    title_pattern="projet",
    exclude=True
)

# Filter by type
individual = api.assignments.filter_by_type(classroom_id=12345, assignment_type="individual")

# Get statistics
stats = api.assignments.get_statistics(67890)
# Returns: submission_rate, pass_rate, total_accepted, etc.
```

### Submissions

```python
# List submissions for an assignment
submissions = api.submissions.list(assignment_id=67890, per_page=100)

# Get all submissions (auto-pagination)
all_subs = api.submissions.get_all(assignment_id=67890)

# Get a specific student's submission
submission = api.submissions.get_by_student(assignment_id=67890, github_username="student123")

# Filter by status
submitted = api.submissions.filter_by_status(assignment_id=67890, submitted=True)
passing = api.submissions.filter_by_status(assignment_id=67890, passing=True)
needs_help = api.submissions.filter_by_status(assignment_id=67890, submitted=True, passing=False)

# Get repository URLs
urls = api.submissions.get_repository_urls(assignment_id=67890, url_type="html")
# url_type: "html" (web), "clone" (https), "ssh"

# Get statistics
stats = api.submissions.get_statistics(67890)
# Returns: avg_commit_count, students_with_commits, etc.
```

### Grades

```python
# Get all grades for an assignment
grades = api.grades.get(assignment_id=67890)

# Export grades to CSV
api.grades.export_to_csv(assignment_id=67890, file_path="grades.csv")

# Get a specific student's grade
grade = api.grades.get_by_student(assignment_id=67890, github_username="student123")

# Get by roster identifier
grade = api.grades.get_by_roster_identifier(assignment_id=67890, roster_identifier="12345678")

# Filter by grading status
graded = api.grades.filter_by_status(assignment_id=67890, graded=True)
ungraded = api.grades.filter_by_status(assignment_id=67890, graded=False)

# Get statistics
stats = api.grades.get_statistics(67890)
# Returns: avg_score, avg_percentage, graded_count, etc.
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Logger

```python
import logging

# Create custom logger
logger = logging.getLogger("my_app")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Initialize API with custom logger
api = ClassroomAPI(token, logger=logger)
```

### Error Handling

```python
from edutools_github_classroom import (
    ClassroomAPI,
    ClassroomAPIError,
    ClassroomAuthenticationError,
    ClassroomResourceNotFoundError
)

try:
    api = ClassroomAPI(token)
    classroom = api.classrooms.get(12345)
except ClassroomAuthenticationError:
    print("Invalid or expired token")
except ClassroomResourceNotFoundError:
    print("Classroom not found")
except ClassroomAPIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e}")
```

### Working with Multiple Classrooms

```python
# Get all IIR5G classrooms
iir_classrooms = api.classrooms.filter_by_name("iir5g")

# Process assignments for each classroom
for classroom in iir_classrooms:
    classroom_id = classroom["id"]
    classroom_name = classroom["name"]
    
    print(f"\n=== {classroom_name} ===")
    
    # Get assignments (excluding projects)
    assignments = api.assignments.filter_by_title(
        classroom_id=classroom_id,
        title_pattern="projet",
        exclude=True
    )
    
    # Process each assignment
    for assignment in assignments:
        assignment_id = assignment["id"]
        title = assignment["title"]
        
        # Get submissions
        submissions = api.submissions.get_all(assignment_id)
        
        # Get grades
        grades = api.grades.get(assignment_id)
        
        # Export
        api.grades.export_to_csv(
            assignment_id,
            f"grades_{classroom_name}_{title}.csv"
        )
        
        print(f"  {title}: {len(submissions)} submissions, {len(grades)} grades")
```
