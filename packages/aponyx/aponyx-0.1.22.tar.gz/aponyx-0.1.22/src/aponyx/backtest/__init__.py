"""
Backtesting engine for CDX overlay strategy.

This module provides a lightweight backtesting framework optimized for
credit index strategies. The design prioritizes transparency and extensibility,
with clean interfaces that can wrap more powerful libraries later.

Core Components
---------------
- engine: Position generation and P&L simulation
- config: Backtest parameters and constraints
- protocols: Abstract interfaces for extensibility
- registry: Strategy catalog management
- calculators: Return calculator protocol and implementations
- calculator_factory: Factory for resolving calculators based on product type

Note: Performance metrics have been moved to aponyx.evaluation.performance
