# Artefacts Toolkit

[Documentation](https://docs.artefacts.com/artefacts-toolkit/)
[Artefacts](https://www.artefacts.com)

The Artefacts Toolkit contains a number of helper functions to assist with developing Robotic Applications. It is primarily designed to be used with [Artefacts](https://www.artefacts.com) and the Artefacts Dashboard, though some functions will work without it.

Helpers include:

* Access configurations made in the `artefacts.yaml` file
* Easy creation of rosbags, and extraction topic messages
* Interact with simulation (Gazebo) environment.
* Image / video creation
* Chart creation

The majority of the toolkit is designed to be used with ROS2 (Harmonic / Jazzy) and its corresponding recommended Gazebo simulator (Fortress / Harmonic).

## Installation

```
pip install artefacts-toolkit
```

_Note: Ros2 Jazzy (Python 3.12) users will need to setup a Python Virtual Environment and add it to their `PYTHONPATH` after sourcing ROS_
