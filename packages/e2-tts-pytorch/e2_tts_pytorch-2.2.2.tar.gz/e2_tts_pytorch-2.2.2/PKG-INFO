## E2 TTS - Pytorch

Implementation of E2-TTS, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18009v1">Embarrassingly Easy Fully Non-Autoregressive Zero-Shot TTS</a>, in Pytorch

The repository differs from the paper in that it uses a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10342">multistream transformer</a> for text and audio, with conditioning done every transformer block in the E2 manner.

It also includes an improvisation that was proven out by Manmay, where the text is simply interpolated to the length of the audio for conditioning. You can try this by setting `interpolated_text = True` on `E2TTS`

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://github.com/manmay-nakhashi">Manmay</a> for contributing <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/e2-tts-pytorch/pull/1">working end-to-end training code</a>!

- <a href="https://github.com/lucasnewman">Lucas Newman</a> for the code contributions, helpful feedback, and for sharing the first set of positive experiments!

- <a href="https://github.com/JingRH">Jing</a> for sharing the second positive result with a multilingual (English + Chinese) dataset!

- <a href="https://github.com/Coice">Coice</a> and <a href="https://github.com/manmay-nakhashi">Manmay</a> for reporting the third and fourth successful runs. Farewell alignment engineering

## Install

```bash
$ pip install e2-tts-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch

from e2_tts_pytorch import (
    E2TTS,
    DurationPredictor
)

duration_predictor = DurationPredictor(
    transformer = dict(
        dim = 512,
        depth = 8,
    )
)

mel = torch.randn(2, 1024, 100)
text = ['Hello', 'Goodbye']

loss = duration_predictor(mel, text = text)
loss.backward()

e2tts = E2TTS(
    duration_predictor = duration_predictor,
    transformer = dict(
        dim = 512,
        depth = 8        
    ),
)

out = e2tts(mel, text = text)
out.loss.backward()

sampled = e2tts.sample(mel[:, :5], text = text)

```
