`microlux` is a <a href='https://github.com/jax-ml/jax'>Jax</a>-based package that can calculate the binary lensing light curve and its derivatives both efficiently and accurately.  We use the modified adaptive contour integratoin in <a href='https://github.com/valboz/VBBinaryLensing'>`VBBinaryLensing`</a> to maximize the performance. 
With the access to the gradient, we can use more advanced algorithms for microlensing modeling, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) in <a href='https://num.pyro.ai/en/latest/mcmc.html#numpyro.infer.hmc.NUTS'>`numpyro`</a>.


## Installation

``` bash
pip install microlux
```
or you can install this package from source for development. 
``` bash 
git clone https://github.com/CoastEgo/microlux.git
cd microlux
pip install -e .
```
## Documentation
The documentation is available at <a href='https://coastego.github.io/microlux/'>here</a>. See this for more details.
