human_prompt = 'Analyze the following unconventional/social initiative and extract a concise summary of its **core problem** (the societal, business, or logistical challenge it addresses) and **key insight** (how it innovates or provides value). Focus on the *why* behind the idea—not the *how*—and maintain a neutral, objective tone. Avoid sensitive details, jargon, or implementation specifics.\n\n    Example input format:\n    *"In 2012, a city hired homeless individuals to carry portable Wi-Fi hotspots in public spaces, creating both internet access and employment opportunities."*\n\n    Your output should prioritize:\n    1. The **primary problem** the initiative tackles (e.g., "digital exclusion in underserved communities").\n    2. The **secondary benefit** (e.g., "empowering marginalized groups through dignified work").\n    Keep responses under 3 sentences.'
