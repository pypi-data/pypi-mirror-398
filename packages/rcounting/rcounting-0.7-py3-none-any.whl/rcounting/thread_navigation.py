    link to the previous submission.

    Sometimes people write weird things in submissions selftexts or in top
    level comments, so we'll potentially be receiving a list of multiple urls,
    and have to pick the best one.

    We also have to take into account that the most common case is that there
    is a single link in the submission self text that points to the right
    place, and so we shouldn't spend too much extra time in handling that case

    We'll use the following approach:

    - Take the first link which has both submission and comment and a
      sufficiently high similarity
    - If there are none, take the first link with both submission and comment
    - If there are none, take the first link with sufficiently high similarity
    - If there are none, take the first link present
    - If there are none, return (None, None)
