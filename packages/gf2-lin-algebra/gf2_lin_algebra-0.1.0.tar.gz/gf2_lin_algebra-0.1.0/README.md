# gf2_lin_algebra

**Python package for linear algebra operations in GF(2)**

A small library that implements linear algebra operations over the finite field **GF(2)** (Galois Field of 2 elements). This is useful for applications in coding theory, cryptography, and algorithms where arithmetic is performed modulo 2.
