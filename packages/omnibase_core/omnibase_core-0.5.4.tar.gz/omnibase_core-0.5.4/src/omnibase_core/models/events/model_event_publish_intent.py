"""
Event publish intent model for coordination I/O.

This module defines the intent event used for coordinating event publishing
between nodes without performing direct domain I/O.

Pattern:
    Node (builds intent) → Kafka (intent topic) → IntentExecutor → Kafka (domain topic)

Example:
    # Reducer publishes intent instead of direct event
    from omnibase_core.constants import TOPIC_EVENT_PUBLISH_INTENT

    intent = ModelEventPublishIntent(
        target_topic=TOPIC_METRICS_RECORDED,
        target_event=metrics_event
    )
    await publish_to_kafka(TOPIC_EVENT_PUBLISH_INTENT, intent)

Note:
    TOPIC_EVENT_PUBLISH_INTENT is now defined in constants_topic_taxonomy.py
    and should be imported from omnibase_core.constants.

    Intent to publish an event to Kafka.
