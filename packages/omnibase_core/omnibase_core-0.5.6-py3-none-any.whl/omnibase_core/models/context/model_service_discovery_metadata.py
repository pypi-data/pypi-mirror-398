Service discovery metadata model for service discovery and composition.

This module provides ModelServiceDiscoveryMetadata, a typed model for service-related
metadata that replaces untyped dict[str, ModelSchemaValue] fields. It captures
service identification, capabilities, and discovery information.

Note:
    This model is distinct from ModelServiceMetadata in models/container/, which
    is used for service registration in the DI container. This model focuses on
    service discovery and composition in distributed systems.

Thread Safety:
    ModelServiceDiscoveryMetadata is immutable (frozen=True) after creation, making it
    thread-safe for concurrent read access from multiple threads or async tasks.

    CAVEAT: The list fields (capabilities, dependencies, tags) can still have their
    contents mutated even on a frozen model (Pydantic's frozen only prevents field
    reassignment, not mutation of mutable container contents). Treat these lists as
    immutable by convention for thread safety.

class ModelServiceDiscoveryMetadata(BaseModel):
    """Service discovery metadata for service discovery and composition.

    Provides typed service identification, capabilities, and discovery
    information. Used for service registration, health checking, and
    dynamic service composition in distributed systems.

    Note:
        This model is distinct from ModelServiceMetadata in models/container/,
        which is used for service registration in the DI container.

    Attributes:
        service_name: Unique service name for discovery. Required field
            that identifies the service in the registry.
        service_version: Semantic version of the service using ModelSemVer.
            Used for version-aware routing and compatibility checks.
        service_instance_id: UUID identifier for this service instance.
            Distinguishes between multiple instances of the same service.
        health_check_url: URL endpoint for health checks. Must be a valid
            HTTP(S) URL when provided (e.g., "https://service:8080/health").
        capabilities: List of service capabilities for feature discovery.
            Services can advertise what operations they support. WARNING:
            While model is frozen, list contents can be mutated. Treat as
            immutable by convention for thread safety.
        dependencies: List of service names this service depends on.
            Used for dependency tracking and startup ordering. WARNING:
            While model is frozen, list contents can be mutated. Treat as
            immutable by convention for thread safety.
        tags: Discovery tags for service categorization and filtering.
            Enables tag-based service lookup (e.g., ["production", "us-west"]).
            WARNING: While model is frozen, list contents can be mutated.
            Treat as immutable by convention for thread safety.
        protocol: Communication protocol for the service. Valid values are
            "grpc", "http", "https", "ws", "wss". Defaults to "grpc".

    Thread Safety:
        This model is frozen (field reassignment prevented) and safe for
        concurrent read access across threads. CAVEAT: The list fields
        (capabilities, dependencies, tags) CAN have their contents mutated
        even on a frozen model. For true thread safety, never modify list
        contents after model creation.
