# briefcase-ai Licensing Overview ## Dual Licensing Model briefcase-ai uses a dual licensing model to balance open source innovation with sustainable development: ### 1. OSS Core (MIT License) - **Location**: `/oss/` directory and root `LICENSE` file - **License**: MIT License - permissive open source - **Includes**: - SDK for instrumentation - Storage layer - Replay engine - Policy framework - API and UI - CLI tools - **Usage**: Free for any purpose including commercial use - **Modifications**: Allowed and encouraged - **Distribution**: Permitted with attribution ### 2. Enterprise Extensions (Commercial License) - **Location**: `/enterprise/` directory - **License**: Proprietary commercial license - **Includes**: - RBAC and SSO integration - Compliance reporting - Hosted service components - Advanced analytics - Priority support - **Usage**: Requires valid Enterprise License Agreement - **Pricing**: Contact enterprise@briefcasebrain.com ## License Boundaries ``` briefcase/ LICENSE (MIT) # Root license for OSS oss/ LICENSE (MIT) # OSS components - free to use enterprise/ LICENSE (Commercial) # Enterprise extensions - requires license ``` ## Key Points 1. **OSS is Fully Functional**: The OSS core provides complete observability and replay functionality without requiring any enterprise components. 2. **No License Mixing**: OSS and enterprise code are clearly separated. You can use OSS without touching enterprise code. 3. **Enterprise is Optional**: Enterprise features extend OSS capabilities but are not required for core functionality. 4. **Clear Attribution**: When using OSS, include the MIT license and attribution in your distribution. ## Common Scenarios ### For Individual Developers - Use OSS freely for personal or commercial projects - Modify and distribute OSS components - Contribute improvements back to the community ### For Startups - Start with OSS for free - Upgrade to Enterprise when you need advanced features - No vendor lock-in - OSS remains free ### For Enterprises - Evaluate with OSS - Purchase Enterprise license for: - SSO/SAML integration - Compliance reporting - SLA guarantees - Priority support ## License Compliance ### Using OSS 1.
