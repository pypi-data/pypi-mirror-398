# Financial Considerations

## Development Investment

**MVP Phase** (Current):
- **Time Investment**: ~200 hours (7 specs @ ~25 hours each + documentation)
- **Infrastructure**: Minimal (local development, Docker for testing)
- **Tools/Services**: Free tier (GitHub, PyPI, community resources)

**Phase 2 Investment** (Estimated):
- **Additional Development**: ~400 hours (12 advanced specs)
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Cloud resources for integration testing (~$50/month)
- **Documentation/Marketing**: Community engagement time (blog posts, videos)

## Revenue Model

**Open Source - Community Supported**:
- Core product remains free and open source (LGPL license)
- Revenue opportunities through:
  - **Enterprise Support**: Consulting, custom integrations, training
  - **Managed Hosting**: Cloud-hosted MCP server as a service
  - **Enterprise Features**: Advanced security, compliance, SLA-backed support

**Current Focus**: Adoption over monetization
- Build community and establish market presence
- Demonstrate value through free, production-ready tool
- Enterprise revenue opportunities emerge naturally from adoption
