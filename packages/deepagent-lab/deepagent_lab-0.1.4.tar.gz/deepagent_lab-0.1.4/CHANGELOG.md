  - Support for absolute paths (`/path/to/agent.py:graph`)
  - Automatic detection of file vs module paths

- **Dynamic Workspace Configuration**: Workspace root now configurable via `DEEPAGENT_WORKSPACE_ROOT`
  - Automatic workspace discovery for agents
  - Environment variable set by extension for agent access
  - Dynamic workspace path resolution

### Changed
- **Standardized Environment Variables**: All variables now use `DEEPAGENT_` prefix for cross-library compatibility
  - `DEEPAGENT_AGENT_SPEC` replaces previous agent configuration
  - `DEEPAGENT_JUPYTER_SERVER_URL` for Jupyter server connection
