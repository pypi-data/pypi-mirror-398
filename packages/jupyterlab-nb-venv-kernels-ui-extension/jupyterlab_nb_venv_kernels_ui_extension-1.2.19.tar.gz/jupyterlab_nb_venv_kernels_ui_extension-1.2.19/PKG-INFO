> **Package Renamed**: This package was renamed from `jupyterlab_launcher_navigate_to_kernel_extension` to `jupyterlab_nb_venv_kernels_ui_extension` in version 1.2.8. If you have the old package installed, please uninstall it first: `pip uninstall jupyterlab-launcher-navigate-to-kernel-extension`

Context menu extension for kernel launcher cards. Right-click on any kernel to navigate to its project directory, open a terminal, or manage the virtual environment. Intended to complement [nb_venv_kernels](https://github.com/stellarshenson/nb_venv_kernels) for workspace management.

## Features

**Context Menu (right-click on kernel launcher card)**:

- **Show in File Browser** - Navigate to the kernel's project root
- **Open Terminal at Location** - Open terminal at the kernel's project directory
- **Unregister Kernel** - Remove kernel from registry (requires [nb_venv_kernels](https://github.com/stellarshenson/nb_venv_kernels))
- **Remove Environment (dangerous)** - Permanently delete local `.venv` environments with confirmation (requires [nb_venv_kernels](https://github.com/stellarshenson/nb_venv_kernels))

**Kernel Menu** (provided by [nb_venv_kernels](https://github.com/stellarshenson/nb_venv_kernels)):

- **Scan for Virtual Environments** - Discover and register new virtual environments in your workspace

**General**:

- **Project-aware navigation** - For `.venv` environments, navigates to project root (one level up from `.venv`)
- **Dynamic kernel support** - Works with `nb_conda_kernels` and `nb_venv_kernels` providers
