# Metformin and Cognitive Impairment: A Comprehensive Evidence Synthesis

## Introduction

Metformin, a widely prescribed antidiabetic medication, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for cognitive impairment and dementia prevention. Given the established link between type 2 diabetes and increased risk of cognitive decline, researchers have investigated whether metformin's metabolic benefits might extend to neuroprotective effects. This synthesis examines the current evidence regarding metformin's impact on cognitive function across diverse populations and clinical contexts.

## Mixed Evidence from Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews

The evidence regarding metformin's cognitive benefits presents a complex picture with conflicting findings across major systematic reviews. A 2024 umbrella review found that [Kuate Defo et al., 2024](docid:pmid-37869901) metformin was associated with significant reduction in dementia risk, though this effect was significant only in Western populations and specifically in United States studies. However, a more recent 2025 meta-analysis by [Hui et al., 2025](docid:pmid-40017057) analyzing 999,349 participants found no significant association between metformin use and reduced dementia risk (RR = 0.94[0.79, 1.13]).

Similarly, a 2022 systematic review by [Tabatabaei Malazy et al., 2022](docid:pmid-35297284) examining 19 studies concluded that metformin had no significant effect on improving cognitive function or protecting against dementia, including vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. This contrasts with findings from [Campbell et al., 2018](docid:pmid-30149446), whose meta-analysis demonstrated that cognitive impairment was significantly less prevalent in diabetic patients using metformin (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78) and dementia incidence was significantly reduced (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.88).

## Positive Findings in Specific Populations

Despite mixed meta-analytic evidence, several individual studies have reported encouraging results in targeted populations. [Nibber et al., 2022](docid:pmid-35513115) found that metformin was significantly superior to placebo in improving cognitive function in patients with clinical conditions associated with cognitive impairment (SMD: 0.80; 95%CI: 0.46 to 1.15; p < 0.001), though this was based on only two studies.

Long-term metformin use has shown particular promise. [Ng et al., 2014](docid:pmid-24577463) demonstrated that among older adults with diabetes, metformin use showed significant linear trends of association with reduced cognitive impairment, with use for more than 6 years associated with the lowest risk in both cross-sectional (OR = 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.80) and longitudinal analyses (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.12-0.60). Similarly, [Shi et al., 2019](docid:pmid-31366635) found that long-term metformin therapy (>2 years) was associated with lower incidence of neurodegenerative disease among elderly veterans with type 2 diabetes, with 2-4 years and >4 years of exposure showing adjusted hazard ratios of 0.62 and 0.19, respectively.

## Clinical Trial Evidence

Randomized controlled trials have provided mixed but generally encouraging results. [Luchsinger et al., 2016](docid:pmid-26890736) conducted a pilot study in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and found that changes in total recall favored the metformin group (9.7±8.5 versus 5.3±8.5; p = 0.02) after adjusting for baseline cognitive scores. [Koenig et al., 2017](docid:pmid-28538088) reported that metformin was associated with improved executive functioning in a crossover study of 20 nondiabetic subjects with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.

Specialized populations have shown particular benefit. [Mone et al., 2023](docid:pmid-37085892) demonstrated that extended-release metformin improved cognitive impairment in frail older women with hypertension and diabetes over 6 months, with significant differences observed between treated and untreated groups. [Guo et al., 2014](docid:pmid-24862430) found that chronic metformin treatment for 24 weeks improved cognitive performance in depressed patients with type 2 diabetes, as assessed by the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised.

## Concerning Findings and Limitations

Several studies have raised concerns about potential negative effects. [Koo et al., 2019](docid:pmid-31119857) found that rapid deterioration of Mini-Mental State Examination and Verbal Immediate Recall scores was more frequently found in the metformin-taking group among older patients with diabetes (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.24-16.05 and OR 7.37, 95% CI 1.19-45.56). [Wennberg et al., 2018](docid:pmid-29873112) reported that metformin was associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (SHR = 2.75; 95% CI = 1.64, 4.63).

[Moore et al., 2013](docid:pmid-24009301) found that among participants with diabetes, worse cognitive performance was associated with metformin use (OR 2.23 [1.05-4.75]), potentially related to metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency. However, vitamin B12 and calcium supplements were associated with better cognitive outcomes, suggesting this effect may be preventable.

## Mechanistic Insights and Combination Therapies

Recent research has begun elucidating potential mechanisms underlying metformin's cognitive effects. [Rosell-Díaz et al., 2024](docid:pmid-38871078) found that metformin-induced changes in gut microbiome composition, particularly the A.muciniphila/R. ilealis ratio, were significantly associated with higher memory scores in men. [Weinberg et al., 2024](docid:pmid-38160357) identified 50 proteins significantly altered in plasma and 26 in cerebrospinal fluid after 8 weeks of metformin use in non-diabetic older adults with mild cognitive impairment.

Combination therapies have shown enhanced benefits. [Jiang et al., 2025](docid:pmid-40853354) found that patients receiving metformin with sulfonylureas or DPP-4 inhibitors experienced significantly slower decline in MMSE scores compared to metformin with thiazolidinediones. [Osman et al., 2025](docid:pmid-39709941) demonstrated that combining DPP-4 or SGLT2 inhibitors with metformin positively impacted cognitive function through metabolic pathway modulation rather than improved glycemic control.

## Structural Brain Changes

Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for metformin's neuroprotective effects on brain structure. [Nabizadeh et al., 2022](docid:pmid-35843348) found that metformin users had significantly higher volumes in multiple brain regions, including bilateral parietal lobes, left cingulate, and right frontal lobe, suggesting protective effects against brain atrophy in non-demented elderly individuals with diabetes.

## Current Clinical Trials and Future Directions

The field is advancing toward more rigorous testing of metformin's cognitive benefits. [Barbera et al., 2024](docid:pmid-38297399) described the MET-FINGER trial protocol, which combines a multimodal lifestyle intervention with metformin in an APOE ε4-enriched population of older adults at increased dementia risk. This represents the first trial combining lifestyle intervention with a putative repurposed disease-modifying drug for cognitive impairment prevention.

## Conclusion

The evidence regarding metformin's benefits for cognitive impairment presents a nuanced picture. While large-scale meta-analyses show inconsistent results, with some finding no overall benefit and others demonstrating significant protective effects, several patterns emerge from the literature. Long-term metformin use (>2-6 years) appears more beneficial than short-term treatment, with effects potentially mediated through gut microbiome changes, metabolic pathway modulation, and neuroprotective mechanisms. Specific populations, including frail elderly women, patients with comorbid depression, and those receiving combination antidiabetic therapies, may derive particular benefit.

The inconsistency in findings may reflect methodological differences, population heterogeneity, confounding by indication, and varying study durations. As [Enderami et al., 2025](docid:pmid-39871536) noted, the inconsistency and low quality of current evidence point toward the need for more rigorous research to determine whether metformin's cognitive effects are protective, neutral, or context-dependent based on patient profiles. Ongoing clinical trials, particularly those testing metformin in non-diabetic populations at risk for cognitive decline, will be crucial for establishing definitive evidence regarding metformin's role in cognitive health.
