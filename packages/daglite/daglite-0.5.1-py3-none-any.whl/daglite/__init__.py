Daglite: Lightweight Python framework for building static DAGs with explicit bindings.

Daglite provides a simple, type-safe way to build and execute directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
of Python functions. Tasks are defined using the @task decorator, composed using calling
and fluent operations (__call__, .partial, .product, .zip, .then, .map, .join), and executed
with evaluate() or evaluate_async().

Key Features:
    - Explicit parameter binding (no implicit dependencies)
    - Fan-out/fan-in patterns with .product() and .zip()
    - Type-safe task composition with generic support
    - Multiple execution backends (local, threading, multiprocessing)
    - Async execution with sibling parallelism via evaluate_async()
    - Lazy evaluation with automatic topological sorting

Basic Usage:
    >>> from daglite import task, evaluate
    >>>
    >>> @task
    >>> def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    ...     return x + y
    >>>
    >>> result = evaluate(add(x=1, y=2))
    >>> print(result)  # 3

Async Usage:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> from daglite import task, evaluate_async
    >>>
    >>> @task
    >>> def slow_io(x: int) -> int:
    ...     # I/O-bound work
    ...     return x * 2
    >>>
    >>> async def main():
    ...     result = await evaluate_async(slow_io.product(x=[1, 2, 3]))
    ...     print(result)  # [2, 4, 6]
    >>>
    >>> asyncio.run(main())
