# EasyEO

EasyEO is a lightweight, extensible Python library for raster-based Earth Observation (EO) analysis which allows for chainable raster processing, algebra, and visualization. 
It provides high-level abstractions over libraries such as Rasterio, NumPy, and Matplotlib, enabling users to perform common earth-observation analyses and visualization tasks efficiently, without dealing with the underlying complexity.
---

## Features

- Raster operations with spatial awareness
- Algebraic operations (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`)
- Resampling, reprojection, and alignment
- Clip rasters using vectors or bounding boxes
- Normalization (min-max, percentile, z-score)
- Visualization helpers (bands, composites, histograms)
- Backend-aware design (NumPy ↔ Rasterio)

---

## Installation

```bash
conda create -n env_name python=3.10
conda activate env_name
pip install easy-eo
```

## Quick Example
```python
from eeo import load_raster

ds_nir = load_raster("path/to/nir.tif")
ds_red = load_raster("path/to/red.tif")

# Chainable example: clip -> resample -> compute NDVI -> multiply
result = ds_nir.clip_raster_with_bbox((0,0,1000,1000))
                .resample(scale_factor=2)
                .normalized_difference(ds_red)
                .multiply(100)
```
