A fork of [gym-retro](https://github.com/openai/retro) ('lets you turn classic video games into Gymnasium environments for reinforcement learning') with additional games, emulators and supported platforms. Since gym-retro is in maintenance now and doesn't accept new games, platforms or bug fixes, you can instead submit PRs with new games or features here in stable-retro.

- [Supported emulators](docs/supported_emulators.md)
- [Supported games/envs](docs/supported_games.md)

## Installation

```
pip3 install stable-retro
```
or if the above doesn't work for your plateform:
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro.git
```

If you plan to integrate new ROMs, states or emulator cores or plan to edit an existing env:
```
git clone https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro.git
cd stable-retro
pip3 install -e .
```

#### Apple Silicon Installation (Tested on python3.10)
- NOTE: The Game Boy (gambatte) emulator is not supported on Apple Silicon

**Build from source**
1. `pip install cmake wheel`
2. `brew install pkg-config lua@5.3 libzip qt@5 capnp`
3. `echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@5/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`
4. `export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path)`
5. `pip install -e .`

**Build Integration UI**
1. build package from source
2. `cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt -DBUILD_UI=ON -UPYLIB_DIRECTORY`
3. `make -j$(sysctl hw.ncpu | cut -d: -f2)`
4. `open "Gym Retro Integration.app"`

Docker image for M1 Macs:

## Example

'Nature CNN' model trained using PPO on Airstriker-Genesis env (rom already included in the repo)

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 11 WSL2 (Ubuntu 20.04 VM)
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip git zlib1g-dev libopenmpi-dev ffmpeg
```
You need to install a stable baselines 3 version that supports gymnasium
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro.git
pip3 install stable_baselines3[extra]
```

Start training:
```
cd retro/examples
python3 ppo.py --game='Airstriker-Genesis-v0'
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [https://stable-retro.farama.org/](https://stable-retro.farama.org/) (work in progress)

See [LICENSES.md](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro/blob/master/LICENSES.md) for information on the licenses of the individual cores.

## ROMs

Each game integration has files listing memory locations for in-game variables, reward functions based on those variables, episode end conditions, savestates at the beginning of levels and a file containing hashes of ROMs that work with these files.

Please note that ROMs are not included and you must obtain them yourself.  Most ROM hashes are sourced from their respective No-Intro SHA-1 sums.

Run this script in the roms folder you want to import. If the checksum matches it will import them in the related game folder in stable-retro.
```bash
python3 -m retro.import .
```

The following non-commercial Sega Genesis ROM is included with Stable Retro for testing purposes:
- [Airstriker](https://pdroms.de/genesis/airstriker-v1-50-genesis-game) by Electrokinesis

 [List of other included ROMs](docs/included_roms.md).

## BIOS

Some plateforms like Sega Saturn and Dreamcast also needs to be provided a BIOS.
