Sliced inference for detecting small objects in large images.

This module provides high-accuracy object detection on large images by slicing 
images into overlapping tiles, running inference on each slice, and merging 
predictions with intelligent NMS/NMM. Designed for simplicity and performance 
following PixelFlow principles with comprehensive edge case handling.

class SlicedInference:
    """Performs sliced inference on large images for improved small object detection.
    
    The main challenge in sliced inference is accurately merging predictions from
    overlapping slices. This implementation handles critical edge cases including
    objects on slice boundaries, nested objects, and partial detections at slice
    edges using intelligent NMS/NMM algorithms with configurable thresholds.
    
    Example:
        >>> import cv2
        >>> import pixelflow as pf
        >>> from ultralytics import YOLO
        >>> 
        >>> # Setup model and sliced inference
        >>> model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
        >>> slicer = pf.SlicedInference(slice_height=640, slice_width=640, overlap_ratio_h=0.2)
        >>> 
        >>> # Define detector function
        >>> def detector_func(image):
        ...     outputs = model.predict(image)
        ...     return pf.results.from_ultralytics(outputs)
        >>> 
        >>> # Run sliced inference on large image
        >>> large_image = cv2.imread("large_image.jpg")  # e.g., 4000x3000
        >>> results = slicer.predict(large_image, detector_func, verbose=True)
        >>> print(f"Detected {len(results)} objects")
        
    Notes:
        - Automatically handles coordinate transformation from slice to full image space
        - Uses intelligent merging to avoid duplicate detections on slice boundaries
        - Supports both NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) and NMM (Non-Maximum Merging)
        - Configurable overlap ratios and thresholds for different use cases

        Notes:
            - Automatically handles coordinate transformation from slice to full image space
            - Detector function should return PixelFlow Detections object for best compatibility
            - Large images benefit most from sliced inference (>2000x2000 pixels)
            - Memory usage scales with number of slices and detections per slice
            - Verbose mode helpful for debugging and performance optimization
            
        Performance Notes:
            - Inference time scales linearly with number of slices
            - Memory usage peaks during coordinate transformation and merging phases
            - GPU memory requirements reduced as model processes smaller slice images
            - Optimal slice size matches your model's training input resolution

def auto_slice_size(image_height: int, image_width: int, target_size: int = 640) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Automatically calculate optimal slice dimensions based on image properties.
    
    Computes slice dimensions that maintain the image's aspect ratio while
    targeting a specific slice size. Ensures slices are neither too small
    (minimum 320px) nor larger than the original image dimensions.
    
    Args:
        image_height (int): Height of the input image in pixels
        image_width (int): Width of the input image in pixels  
        target_size (int): Target dimension for the larger side of each slice.
                          Will be adjusted to maintain aspect ratio. Default is 640.
                          
    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: Optimal (slice_height, slice_width) dimensions that
                        maintain aspect ratio and respect size constraints.
                        
    Example:
        >>> import pixelflow as pf
        >>> 
        >>> # Square image - both dimensions equal target_size
        >>> h, w = pf.auto_slice_size(2000, 2000, target_size=640)
        >>> print(f"Square image slices: {h}x{w}")
        Square image slices: 640x640
        >>> 
        >>> # Wide image - width gets target_size, height scaled down
        >>> h, w = pf.auto_slice_size(1500, 3000, target_size=640) 
        >>> print(f"Wide image slices: {h}x{w}")
        Wide image slices: 320x640
        >>> 
        >>> # Tall image - height gets target_size, width scaled down
        >>> h, w = pf.auto_slice_size(4000, 1500, target_size=640)
        >>> print(f"Tall image slices: {h}x{w}")
        Tall image slices: 640x240  # But minimum 320, so actually 640x320
        >>> 
        >>> # Small image - slices limited by original dimensions
        >>> h, w = pf.auto_slice_size(500, 800, target_size=640)
        >>> print(f"Small image slices: {h}x{w}")
        Small image slices: 500x800
        >>> 
        >>> # Use with SlicedInference
        >>> image_h, image_w = 3000, 4500  # Large image
        >>> slice_h, slice_w = pf.auto_slice_size(image_h, image_w)
        >>> slicer = pf.SlicedInference(slice_height=slice_h, slice_width=slice_w)
        
    Notes:
        - Maintains original image aspect ratio in slice dimensions
        - Enforces minimum slice size of 320px on both dimensions
        - Never creates slices larger than the original image
        - Wider images result in wider slices with proportionally smaller height
        - Taller images result in taller slices with proportionally smaller width
        
    Performance Notes:
        - Larger slices reduce total slice count but may miss small objects
        - Smaller slices increase processing time but improve small object detection
        - 640px target size works well for most YOLO-based models
        - Consider model input size when choosing target_size
