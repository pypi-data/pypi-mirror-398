              of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
              but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
              sublicense, and distribute the Work and its Derivative Works in
              Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, trademark, patent,
                  attribution and other notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright notice to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Disclaimer of Warranty. UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
              AGREED TO IN WRITING, LICENSOR PROVIDES THE WORK (AND EACH
              CONTRIBUTOR PROVIDES ITS CONTRIBUTIONS) ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
              IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
              OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           7. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
              WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
              UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW (SUCH AS DELIBERATE AND GROSSLY
              NEGLIGENT ACTS) OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE
              LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
              INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A
              RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
              WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
              WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL
              OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES), EVEN IF SUCH CONTRIBUTOR
              HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        
           8. Accepting Warranty or Support. You may choose to offer, and to
              charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or other liability
              obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
              accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and
              on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
              and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
              harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
              such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
              support.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

**Simple, intuitive tracing SDK for LLM applications and multi-agent systems.**

Noveum Trace provides an easy way to add observability to your LLM applications. With intuitive context managers, you can trace function calls, LLM interactions, agent workflows, and multi-agent coordination patterns.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Simple Context Manager API** - Add tracing with intuitive `with` statements
- **🤖 Multi-Agent Support** - Built for multi-agent systems and workflows
- **☁️ Cloud Integration** - Send traces to Noveum platform or custom endpoints
- **🔌 Framework Agnostic** - Works with any Python LLM framework
- **🚀 Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **📊 Comprehensive Tracing** - Capture function calls, LLM interactions, and agent workflows
- **🔄 Flexible Integration** - Context managers for granular control

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install noveum-trace
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import noveum_trace

# Initialize the SDK
noveum_trace.init(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    project="my-llm-app"
)

# Trace any operation using context managers
def process_document(document_id: str) -> dict:
    with noveum_trace.trace_operation("process_document") as span:
        # Your function logic here
        span.set_attribute("document_id", document_id)
        return {"status": "processed", "id": document_id}

# Trace LLM calls with automatic metadata capture
def call_openai(prompt: str) -> str:
    import openai
    client = openai.OpenAI()
    
    with noveum_trace.trace_llm_call(model="gpt-4", provider="openai") as span:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        span.set_attributes({
            "llm.input_tokens": response.usage.prompt_tokens,
            "llm.output_tokens": response.usage.completion_tokens
        })
        return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## 📦 Import Patterns

Noveum Trace supports multiple import patterns. Choose the one that best fits your coding style:

### Recommended: Direct Imports from Package Root

This is the recommended approach for most use cases:

```python
from noveum_trace import init, trace_context, NoveumClient
from noveum_trace import trace_llm_call, trace_operation, trace_agent_operation
```

**Available imports from root:**
- **Core functions**: `init`, `shutdown`, `flush`, `configure`, `get_config`, `get_client`
- **Context managers**: `trace_context`, `trace_llm_call`, `trace_operation`, `trace_agent_operation`, `trace_batch_operation`, `trace_pipeline_stage`, `create_child_span`, `trace_function_calls`
- **Core classes**: `NoveumClient`, `Trace`, `Span`, `ContextualTrace`
- **Integrations**: `NoveumTraceCallbackHandler` (LangChain integration)

### Alternative: Module-Level Imports

For simple scripts or when you prefer namespace qualification:

```python
import noveum_trace

# Initialize
noveum_trace.init(project="my-app", api_key="your-api-key")

# Use context managers
with noveum_trace.trace_llm_call(model="gpt-4") as span:
    # Your code here
    pass

# Flush traces
noveum_trace.flush()
```

### Submodule Imports (When Needed)

For advanced use cases or when importing items not in the root `__all__`:

```python
# Integrations (conditional - requires langchain/livekit)
from noveum_trace.integrations.langchain import NoveumTraceCallbackHandler
from noveum_trace.integrations.livekit import (
    LiveKitSTTWrapper,
    LiveKitTTSWrapper,
    setup_livekit_tracing,
)

# Core submodules (also valid, but root imports preferred)
from noveum_trace.core.client import NoveumClient
from noveum_trace.core.span import Span, SpanStatus
from noveum_trace.core.trace import Trace
```

### What Doesn't Work

These import patterns will fail:

```python
# ❌ NoveumTrace class doesn't exist
from noveum_trace import NoveumTrace  # ModuleNotFoundError

# ❌ Wrong path - should be core.client or root import
from noveum_trace.client import NoveumClient  # ModuleNotFoundError
# ✅ Correct:
from noveum_trace import NoveumClient
# or
from noveum_trace.core.client import NoveumClient
```

### Quick Reference Table

| What to Import | Recommended Import | Alternative |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Initialize SDK | `from noveum_trace import init` | `import noveum_trace` then `noveum_trace.init()` |
| LLM tracing | `from noveum_trace import trace_llm_call` | `import noveum_trace` then `noveum_trace.trace_llm_call()` |
| Context manager | `from noveum_trace import trace_context` | `import noveum_trace` then `noveum_trace.trace_context()` |
| Client class | `from noveum_trace import NoveumClient` | `from noveum_trace.core.client import NoveumClient` |
| LangChain integration | `from noveum_trace.integrations.langchain import NoveumTraceCallbackHandler` | `from noveum_trace.integrations import NoveumTraceCallbackHandler` (also works) |

## ⚙️ Setup

### Core Configuration

The SDK requires a few core environment variables to function:

```bash
# Required: Your Noveum API key
export NOVEUM_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Required: Project name for organizing traces
export NOVEUM_PROJECT="your-project-name"

# Optional: Environment name (defaults to "development")
export NOVEUM_ENVIRONMENT="production"

# Optional: Custom API endpoint (defaults to https://api.noveum.ai/api)
export NOVEUM_ENDPOINT="https://api.noveum.ai/api"
```

### Additional Environment Variables

For a complete list of all available environment variables including debug settings, logging configuration, and agent registry limits, see [`.env.example`](.env.example) in the repository root.

export NOVEUM_PROJECT="your-project-name"
export NOVEUM_ENVIRONMENT="production"
```

### Programmatic Configuration

```python
import noveum_trace

# Basic configuration
noveum_trace.init(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    project="my-project",
    environment="production"
)

# Advanced configuration with transport settings
noveum_trace.init(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    project="my-project",
    environment="production",
    transport_config={
        "batch_size": 50,
        "batch_timeout": 2.0,
        "retry_attempts": 3,
        "timeout": 30
    },
    tracing_config={
        "sample_rate": 1.0,
        "capture_errors": True,
        "capture_stack_traces": False
    }
)
```

## 🔄 Context Manager Usage

For scenarios with granular control:

```python
import noveum_trace

def process_user_query(user_input: str) -> str:
    # Pre-processing (not traced)
    cleaned_input = user_input.strip().lower()

    # Trace just the LLM call
    with noveum_trace.trace_llm_call(model="gpt-4", provider="openai") as span:
        response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": cleaned_input}]
        )

        # Add custom attributes
        span.set_attributes({
            "llm.input_tokens": response.usage.prompt_tokens,
            "llm.output_tokens": response.usage.completion_tokens
        })

    # Post-processing (not traced)
    return format_response(response.choices[0].message.content)

def multi_step_workflow(task: str) -> dict:
    results = {}

    # Trace agent operation
    with noveum_trace.trace_agent_operation(
        agent_type="planner",
        operation="task_planning"
    ) as span:
        plan = create_task_plan(task)
        span.set_attribute("plan.steps", len(plan.steps))
        results["plan"] = plan

    # Trace tool usage
    with noveum_trace.trace_operation("database_query") as span:
        data = query_database(plan.query)
        span.set_attributes({
            "query.results_count": len(data),
            "query.table": "tasks"
        })
        results["data"] = data

    return results
```

## 🔗 LangChain Integration

Noveum Trace provides seamless integration with LangChain and LangGraph applications through a simple callback handler.

```python
from noveum_trace.integrations.langchain import NoveumTraceCallbackHandler
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize Noveum Trace
import noveum_trace
noveum_trace.init(project="my-langchain-app", api_key="your-api-key")

# Create callback handler
handler = NoveumTraceCallbackHandler()

# Add to your LangChain components
llm = ChatOpenAI(callbacks=[handler])
response = llm.invoke("What is the capital of France?")
```

### What Gets Traced

- **LLM Calls**: Model, prompts, responses, token usage
- **Chains**: Input/output flow, execution steps  
- **Agents**: Decision-making, tool usage, reasoning
- **Tools**: Function calls, inputs, outputs
- **LangGraph Nodes**: Graph execution, node transitions
- **Routing Decisions**: Conditional routing logic and decisions

### Advanced Features

The integration also supports:
- **Manual Trace Control** for complex workflows
- **Custom Parent Relationships** for explicit span hierarchies
- **LangGraph Routing Tracking** for routing decisions

For complete details and examples, see the [LangChain Integration Guide](docs/LANGCHAIN_INTEGRATION.md).

## 🎤 LiveKit Integration

Automatically trace LiveKit agent sessions with complete observability:

```python
import noveum_trace
from livekit.agents import Agent, AgentSession, JobContext
from livekit.plugins import deepgram, cartesia
from noveum_trace.integrations.livekit import (
    LiveKitSTTWrapper,
    LiveKitTTSWrapper,
    setup_livekit_tracing,
)

# Initialize noveum-trace
noveum_trace.init(project="livekit-agent")

async def agent_entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    # Wrap STT/TTS providers for detailed audio tracking
    traced_stt = LiveKitSTTWrapper(
        stt=deepgram.STT(model="nova-2"),
        session_id=ctx.job.id,
        job_context={"job_id": ctx.job.id, "room": ctx.room.name}
    )
    
    traced_tts = LiveKitTTSWrapper(
        tts=cartesia.TTS(model="sonic-english"),
        session_id=ctx.job.id,
        job_context={"job_id": ctx.job.id}
    )
    
    # Create session with traced providers
    session = AgentSession(stt=traced_stt, tts=traced_tts)
    
    # Enable session tracing for automatic event tracking
    # This creates the trace automatically - no need for start_trace()
    setup_livekit_tracing(session)
    
    agent = Agent(instructions="You are a helpful assistant.")
    await ctx.connect()
    await session.start(agent)  # Complete tracing active!
```

### What Gets Traced

**Session Events** (automatic):
- **AgentSession Events**: State changes, transcriptions, function calls, errors, metrics
- **RealtimeSession Events**: Speech detection, transcriptions, generations (when using RealtimeModel)
- **Automatic Trace Creation**: Trace is created when `session.start()` is called

**STT/TTS Operations** (via wrappers):
- **STT Operations**: Transcripts, confidence scores, audio files, durations
- **TTS Operations**: Synthesized text, audio files, durations
- **Job Context**: Room info, participant details, agent metadata
- **Audio Capture**: Automatic saving of audio files for debugging

### Key Features

- ✅ **Complete Observability**: Session events + detailed STT/TTS tracking
- ✅ **Zero Configuration**: Session tracing creates trace automatically
- ✅ Works with **any** LiveKit STT/TTS provider
- ✅ Automatic audio file capture and storage
- ✅ Rich metadata in span attributes
- ✅ Graceful degradation (no disruption if tracing fails)

For step-by-step setup instructions, see the [LiveKit Integration Guide](docs/LIVEKIT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md).
