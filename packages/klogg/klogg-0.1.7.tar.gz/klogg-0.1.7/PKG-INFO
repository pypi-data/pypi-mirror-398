klogg — simple command line work logger
======================================

klogg is a small command-line tool for keeping simple timestamped work logs. It's designed to be minimal and friction-free: append entries with a single command and view per-day or per-month summaries including durations.

Project
-------
- Name: klogg

- Author: Predrag Mandic <predrag@nul.one>
- License: MIT

Installation
------------
From the project root you can install locally:

- Editable install (for development):
  pip install -e .

- Or build and install:
  pip install .

klogg exposes a console script named `klogg` (entry point: klogg.cli:main).

Log files and layout
--------------------
- Default log directory: /home/peja/.config/klogg
- Monthly log files are named YYYY-MM.log (for example: /home/peja/.config/klogg/2025-12.log).
- There is also legacy support for `default.log`.

Log line format
---------------
Each log line is written with a timestamp and the message:

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>  <message>

Example:
2025-12-15 11:15:00>  Fixed the widget

Special markers
---------------
- <start> — marks the start of a session (the line itself is not shown in summaries; it acts as a starting timestamp for the next entry).
- <break> — marks a short break. Break entries are excluded from total time calculations.

Commands
--------
When you run `klogg` without a subcommand it behaves like `klogg day` and shows today's entries.

Common commands:

- klogg --help
  Show usage and available commands and options.

- klogg --version
  Print the installed klogg version.

- klogg add <message> (alias: klogg a <message>)
  Append a timestamped log line with the given message.
  Example:
    klogg add Fixed the widget

- klogg break [message] (aliases: b, p)
  Append a break entry. If you pass a message it becomes: "<break> <message>"
  Example:
    klogg break grabbed coffee

- klogg start (alias: s)
  Append the literal "<start>" marker.

- klogg ls [WHEN]
  Print raw log lines for a month.
  WHEN formats accepted:
    - YYYY-MM (exact month)
    - MM     (assumes current year)
  If omitted, shows the current month's raw lines.

- klogg day [WHEN] (alias: d)
  Show parsed entries for a day with durations and totals.
  WHEN accepted:
    - YYYY-MM-DD
    - MM-DD    (assumes current year)
    - DD       (assumes current month & year)
    - -N       (negative integer, e.g. -1 for yesterday; when passed as a positional argument it must be prefixed with `--` so the CLI doesn't treat it as an option: `klogg day -- -1`)
  Output format:
    YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [HH:MM]>  MARKER_AND_DESCRIPTION
  The total excludes entries that begin with "<break>".
  Options:
    --grep, -g    Filter entries by a case-insensitive substring. Only matching entries are shown and included in the reported total.

- klogg week [WHEN] (alias: w)
  Show parsed entries for an ISO week with durations and a total.
  WHEN accepted:
    - WW        (week number, assumes current year)
    - YYYY-WW   (year-week, e.g. 2025-52)
    - -N        (negative integer, e.g. -1 for previous week; when passed positionally use `--` as in `klogg week -- -1`)
  Weeks follow ISO week numbering (date.isocalendar()), so week 1 is the first ISO week of the year.
  Options:
    --grep, -g    Filter entries by a case-insensitive substring. Only matching entries are shown and included in the reported total.

- klogg month [WHEN] (alias: m)
  Show parsed entries for a month and a total.
  WHEN accepted:
    - YYYY-MM
    - MM (assumes current year)
    - -N (negative integer, e.g. -1 for previous month; when passed positionally use `--` as in `klogg month -- -1`)
  Options:
    --grep, -g    Filter entries by a case-insensitive substring. Only matching entries are shown and included in the reported total.

- klogg rm
  Remove the last log entry from the most recent log file. The command prints the last entry and asks for confirmation before deleting.

Behavior notes
--------------
- Each appended entry uses the current timestamp as the "end time" for the task. Durations are computed as the difference between an entry's timestamp and the previous entry's timestamp.
- The "<start>" line is not printed in day/month summaries; it only sets the "previous timestamp" for the next entry.
- Breaks ("<break>") are printed but excluded from the totals.

Development notes

- Dependencies:
  - click >= 8.0
  - click-aliases >= 1.0
