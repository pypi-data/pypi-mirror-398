  scramble: list = Scramble.Cube2x2x2() # Create the scramble
  print(f'A 2x2x2 Scramble: {scramble}')   # Show it
```

```sh
# Your output must look similar like this:
A 2x2x2 Scramble: ['R2', "F'", 'R2', 'F', "R'", 'U', 'R2', 'U', "F'"]

if __name__ == '__main__':
  scramble: list = Scramble.Cube3x3x3() # Create the scramble

  # Show it
  for move in scramble:
      print(move, end='  ')
