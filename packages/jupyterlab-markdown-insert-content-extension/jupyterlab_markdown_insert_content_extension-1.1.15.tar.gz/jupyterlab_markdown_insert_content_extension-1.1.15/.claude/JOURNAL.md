# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

---

1. **Task - Project initialization and configuration**: Set up project-level Claude configuration by creating `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with project context for JupyterLab extension development and `.claude/JOURNAL.md` for tracking substantive work<br>
   **Result**: Established local configuration importing workspace-level rules with technology stack details (JupyterLab 4.x, TypeScript, Python), naming conventions, and development workflow guidelines

2. **Task - TOC generation research**: Analyzed jupyterlab_markdown_viewer_toc_fix repository to understand JupyterLab's TOC mechanisms, markdown anchor generation, and navigation patterns<br>
   **Result**: Documented findings on JupyterLab's TOC system including heading extraction, anchor ID generation rules (initially assumed GitHub-style lowercase), sanitizer behavior with data-jupyter-id attributes, and TableOfContentsUtils API usage

3. **Task - Core TOC insertion implementation**: Implemented table of contents insertion feature with heading extraction, anchor ID generation, and cursor-aware insertion for both markdown file editors and notebook cells<br>
   **Result**: Created complete TOC insertion functionality in src/index.ts with context menu integration, dual-mode operation (file editor and notebook), hierarchical indentation (2 spaces per level), and proper markdown link formatting

4. **Task - Settings system implementation**: Added configurable settings for TOC generation including caption text and maximum heading level with JupyterLab settings registry integration<br>
   **Result**: Created schema/plugin.json with validation rules, implemented ISettingRegistry integration with live updates, and established defaults (tocCaption: "## Table of Contents", tocMaxLevel: 6) with settings accessible via JupyterLab Settings Editor

5. **Task - Code block filtering enhancement**: Enhanced heading extraction to exclude headings within fenced code blocks (``` and ~~~) to prevent false positives in generated TOC<br>
   **Result**: Implemented state tracking in extractHeadings function to toggle inCodeBlock flag and skip lines within code fence boundaries, preventing code examples from appearing in table of contents

6. **Task - Anchor ID generation correction**: Fixed anchor ID generation to match JupyterLab's actual format which preserves Title-Case and special characters rather than GitHub-style lowercase<br>
   **Result**: Updated generateHeadingId function to preserve case and special characters (colons, commas, parentheses), replace only spaces with hyphens, and remove trailing pilcrow symbols (¶), ensuring generated links match JupyterLab's data-jupyter-id attributes exactly (e.g., "Technology Decision Summary¶" -> "Technology-Decision-Summary")

7. **Task - Version and release preparation**: Incremented version from 0.1.0 to 1.0.18 marking production readiness with all core features implemented and tested<br>
   **Result**: Updated package.json version to 1.0.18 with complete feature set including TOC insertion, settings integration, code block filtering, and JupyterLab-compatible anchor generation ready for deployment

8. **Task - Settings default adjustment**: Changed default maximum heading level from 6 to 3 for more focused table of contents generation<br>
   **Result**: Updated schema/plugin.json and src/index.ts to set tocMaxLevel default to 3, limiting TOC to H1-H3 headings by default while maintaining user configurability (1-6 range)

9. **Task - README documentation update**: Rewrote README.md following modus primaris principles with features listed first, all standard badges, and integrated screenshots<br>
   **Result**: Created flowing narrative documentation with GitHub Actions, npm, PyPI, and download badges, prominent features section with bullet points, concise usage instructions, and three screenshots (.resources/screenshot-menu.png, screenshot-toc.png, screenshot-settings.png) showing context menu, generated TOC output, and settings interface with brief explanatory text before each image

10. **Task - GitHub Actions workflow update**: Replaced default workflow files with production-ready configurations from jupyterlab_markdown_viewer_toc_fix reference implementation<br>
    **Result**: Created six workflow files - build.yml (CI with lint, test, build, package, isolated test, and integration tests), check-release.yml (release validation), enforce-label.yml (PR label enforcement), prep-release.yml (manual release preparation), publish-release.yml (two-step release publishing with npm/PyPI), and update-integration-tests.yml (Playwright snapshot updates via PR comments) with proper package naming jupyterlab_markdown_insert_content_extension throughout

11. **Task - Context menu visibility fix**: Fixed context menu to only appear in appropriate editing contexts - markdown files and notebook markdown cells in edit mode<br>
    **Result**: Implemented `isVisible` function checking file extension (.md, .markdown) for file editors and `jp-mod-editMode` class for notebook cells. Updated selectors from overly specific (`.jp-FileEditor .jp-FileEditorCodeWrapper`, `.jp-Notebook .jp-MarkdownCell.jp-mod-editMode .jp-InputArea-editor`) to broader selectors (`.jp-FileEditor`, `.jp-Notebook .jp-Cell`) with visibility filtering. Removed `document.activeElement` check that caused menu item to disappear on mouse hover

12. **Task - Execute function context detection fix**: Fixed TOC insertion to correctly detect active context (file editor vs notebook) using shell.currentWidget comparison<br>
    **Result**: Rewrote execute function to check `app.shell.currentWidget` against tracker widgets, testing notebook first then file editor. Ensures correct insertion target when both file editors and notebooks are open simultaneously. Version bumped through 1.0.25-1.0.30 during iterative fixes

13. **Task - Default TOC caption update**: Changed default TOC caption from HTML h2 to bold markdown<br>
    **Result**: Updated both src/index.ts and schema/plugin.json defaults from `<h2>Table of Contents</h2>` to `**Table of Contents**` for cleaner markdown output that doesn't create a heading entry

14. **Task - Notebook cell execute fix**: Fixed TOC insertion failing in notebook markdown cells due to edit mode check in execute function<br>
    **Result**: Removed `jp-mod-editMode` class check from execute function since cell exits edit mode when context menu is clicked. The isVisible function already validates edit mode when showing the menu item, so execute only needs to verify active cell is markdown type. Version 1.0.31

15. **Task - Context menu selector fix for notebook cells**: Fixed menu item not appearing in notebook markdown cells by using correct CSS selector<br>
    **Result**: After multiple iterations testing various selectors (`.jp-Notebook .jp-Cell`, `.jp-Notebook .jp-MarkdownCell.jp-mod-editMode`), settled on `.jp-MarkdownCell .jp-InputArea-editor` which targets the editor area that only exists in edit mode. Simplified `isVisible` to always return true for notebooks since selector handles filtering. Version 1.0.37

16. **Task - Release preparation v1.0.38**: Ran lint and prettier checks, built and attempted publish<br>
    **Result**: Fixed package-lock.json formatting, version bumped to 1.0.38. npm publish failed due to expired access token - requires `npm login` before retry

17. **Task - Hierarchical heading numbering feature** (v1.1.0): Implemented comprehensive heading numbering system with TOC integration<br>
    **Result**: Added five new commands (Add/Remove/Update Heading Numbering, Update TOC) plus settings for numberingMaxLevel and numberingTrailingDot. Core implementation includes `generateNumbering()`, `addNumberingToText()`, `removeNumberingFromText()` functions with two-pass processing - first pass numbers headings and collects mappings, second pass updates TOC links. Numbering follows pattern "1.", "1.1.", "1.1.1." with configurable trailing dot (default: enabled). TOC generation now wraps content in `<!-- TOC:BEGIN -->` and `<!-- TOC:END -->` markers enabling Update TOC command. Update Numbering automatically regenerates TOC when markers present. Context menu reorganized into "Markdown Tools" submenu using @lumino/widgets Menu class. Updated README with new features and usage instructions. Version 1.1.1

18. **Task - TOC exclusion and whitespace fixes** (v1.1.5): Added heading exclusion marker and fixed TOC update whitespace handling<br>
    **Result**: Added `<!-- TOC:IGNORE -->` marker to exclude specific headings from TOC while preserving numbering. Marker can be placed inline after heading or on the next line. Fixed `findAndReplaceTOC()` function to preserve original whitespace after `<!-- TOC:END -->` marker instead of collapsing newlines. Updated `extractHeadings()` to check for inline and next-line ignore markers, skip matched headings from TOC output, and strip any inline HTML comments from heading text for clean TOC entries. Version 1.1.5

19. **Task - Toggle TOC ignore menu item** (v1.1.6): Added context menu command to toggle TOC:IGNORE marker on heading at cursor<br>
    **Result**: Added `toggleTOCIgnore` command with "Toggle Exclude from TOC" label in Markdown Tools submenu. Implemented `toggleTOCIgnoreInFileEditor()` and `toggleTOCIgnoreInNotebook()` functions that detect if cursor is on a heading line, then add or remove the `<!-- TOC:IGNORE -->` marker. If marker present, removes it; if absent, appends it to end of heading line. Works in both markdown file editors and notebook markdown cells. Version 1.1.6

20. **Task - Playwright integration tests and CI/CD setup** (v1.1.6): Created comprehensive Playwright test suite and updated Makefile with test targets<br>
    **Result**: Wrote 15 integration tests in `ui-tests/tests/jupyterlab_markdown_insert_content_extension.spec.ts` covering Extension Activation, TOC Generation (submenu visibility, insert/update TOC, code block exclusion), Heading Numbering (add/remove/update with TOC sync), TOC:IGNORE Marker (exclusion and toggle), Feature Interactions (full workflow, maxLevel setting, whitespace preservation), and Notebook Markdown Cells. Updated `playwright.config.js` with increased timeouts (120s test, 180s webServer). Added `install_test_dependencies` and `integration_test` targets to Makefile. CI/CD workflow already configured with Playwright browser caching and dependency installation. Fixed flaky tests by simplifying markdown content to avoid `keyboard.type()` mangling issues with complex multi-line strings. Updated README to show screenshots above features list and added TOC:IGNORE feature documentation

21. **Task - Settings defaults update** (v1.1.11): Changed default numbering settings for broader coverage<br>
    **Result**: Updated `numberingMaxLevel` default from 3 to 5 to apply numbering up to H5 headings. Changed `numberingTrailingDot` default from true to false for cleaner numbering format (1.1 vs 1.1.). Both schema/plugin.json and src/index.ts updated. Published to npm and PyPI

22. **Task - Integration test fixes** (v1.1.12): Updated Playwright tests to match new default settings<br>
    **Result**: Fixed 5 failing tests in `ui-tests/tests/jupyterlab_markdown_insert_content_extension.spec.ts` by updating assertions to match `numberingTrailingDot: false` default (e.g., `'# 1 First'` instead of `'# 1. First'`). Updated maxLevel test from level 3 to level 5 default, now testing all 6 heading levels with assertions that H1-H5 get numbered and H6 remains unnumbered

23. **Task - TOC DEPTH parameter support** (v1.1.13): Added per-TOC depth configuration via marker parameter<br>
    **Result**: Extended TOC:BEGIN marker to support optional DEPTH parameter (e.g., `<!-- TOC:BEGIN DEPTH=2 -->`). When inserting TOC, depth from settings is embedded in marker. When updating TOC, depth is parsed from existing marker and preserved - if no DEPTH present, settings default is used and added to marker. Implementation includes `TOC_BEGIN_PATTERN` regex for parsing, `generateTOCBeginMarker()` helper, and `findTOC()` function returning depth alongside position info. Updated `updateTOCInFileEditor()` and `updateTOCInNotebook()` to use effective depth from marker or settings. Added integration test verifying DEPTH=2 limits TOC to H1-H2 headings only and is preserved across updates

24. **Task - README badges and features update** (v1.1.14): Added missing badges and documented DEPTH feature<br>
    **Result**: Added KOLOMOLO and PayPal Donate badges to README.md. Added per-TOC depth configuration to features list documenting the `<!-- TOC:BEGIN DEPTH=N -->` marker syntax
