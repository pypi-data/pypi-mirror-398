- **Future users** - Automatically becomes Apache 2.0 in 4 years

## 🤔 Common Questions

### Q: Does this affect me if I'm already using DevRules?

**A:** 
- If you're a **small company (< 100 employees)**: No impact. Continue using for free.
- If you're using for **non-production**: No impact. Continue using for free.
- If you're a **large company (100+)** using in production: You'll need to purchase a commercial license.

We're offering a **90-day grace period** for existing users to purchase if needed.

### Q: Can I still contribute to DevRules?

**A:** Yes! We welcome contributions. All contributions will be under the BSL license. When the Change Date arrives, your contributions will be under Apache 2.0.

### Q: What if I don't agree with this change?

**A:** 
- Previous versions (0.1.4 and earlier) remain under MIT license
- You can continue using those versions under MIT terms
- The BSL only applies to version 0.1.5 and later

- Standard: ~$5,000 - $15,000/year (varies by company size)
