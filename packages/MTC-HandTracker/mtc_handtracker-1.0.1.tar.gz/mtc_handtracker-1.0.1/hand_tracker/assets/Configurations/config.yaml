# Gesture configuration using wrist-relative coefficients
gestures:
  # A finger is DOWN (0) if its (tip-to-wrist distance)
  # is less than its (total "bone path" distance) * coeff.
  #
  # A straight finger has a ratio of ~1.0. A bent finger is < 1.0.
  # The "Ratio:" values printed on-screen show this current ratio.
  #
  # To make a finger "DOWN" trigger more easily, *increase* the coeff (e.g., 0.95).
  # To make it trigger "UP" more easily, *decrease* the coeff (e.g., 0.85).

  # All values MUST be less than 1.0

# Proximity-Based Gestures
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These define gestures based on relative ratios between landmarks.
proximity_gestures:
  # A "PINCH" is triggered when the ratio of
  # (ThumbTip-to-IndexTip distance) / (Palm Width distance)
  # is LESS than this threshold.
  #
  # A smaller value means fingers must be closer.
  # Good starting value: 0.3
