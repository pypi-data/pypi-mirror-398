# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Gesture Definitions
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each gesture has the following properties:
#
# REQUIRED:
# 1. pattern: A 5-element list for [Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky]
#
# OPTIONAL:
# 2. direction: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "ALL"
# 3. direction_finger: The finger whose direction is checked.
# 4. proximity_threshold: A float. If present, the "pinch_metric"
#                         (ThumbTip-to-IndexTip ratio) MUST be
#                         LESS than this value.
#
# Note: The system finds the *first* match from top to bottom.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Proximity Gestures ---
# These are checked first and are most specific.

PINCH:
  pattern: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] # Thumb up, Index up, others down
  direction: "ALL"
  proximity_threshold: 0.35

OK:
  pattern: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] # Thumb up, Index down, others up
  direction: "ALL"
  proximity_threshold: 0.35 # Same metric, different pattern

# --- Non-Directional Gestures ---

FIST:
  pattern: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  direction: "ALL"
  # No proximity_threshold, so it's not checked.

OPEN_PALM:
  pattern: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  direction: "ALL"

CALL_ME:
  pattern: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  direction: "ALL"

# --- Directional Gestures (Index Finger) ---

POINT:
  pattern: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  direction: "UP"
  direction_finger: "INDEX"

POINT_LEFT:
  pattern: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  direction: "LEFT"
  direction_finger: "INDEX"

POINT_RIGHT:
  pattern: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  direction: "RIGHT"
  direction_finger: "INDEX"

PEACE:
  pattern: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  direction: "UP"
  direction_finger: "INDEX"

THREE:
  pattern: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  direction: "UP"
  direction_finger: "INDEX"

# --- Directional Gestures (Thumb) ---
# These gestures check both pattern and the thumb's direction.

THUMBS_UP:
  pattern: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  direction: "UP"
  direction_finger: "THUMB"

THUMBS_DOWN:
  pattern: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  direction: "DOWN"
  direction_finger: "THUMB"
