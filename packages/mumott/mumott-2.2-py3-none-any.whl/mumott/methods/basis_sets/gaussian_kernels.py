class GaussianKernels(BasisSet):
    r""" Basis set class for gaussian kernels, a simple local representation on the sphere.
    The kernels follow a pseudo-even distribution similar to that described by
    Y. Kurihara `in 1965 <https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493%281965%29093%3C0399%3ANIOTPE%3E2.3.CO%3B2>`_,
    except with offsets added at the poles.

    Notes
    -----
    The Gaussian kernel at location :math:`\rho_i` is given by

    .. math ::
        N_i \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d(\rho_i, r)}{\sigma}\right)^2 \right]

    .. math ::
        \sigma = \frac{\nu \pi}{2 (g + 1)}

    where :math:`\nu` is the kernel scale parameter and :math:`g` is the grid scale, and

    .. math ::
        d(\rho, r) = \arctan_2(\Vert \rho \times r \Vert, \rho \cdot r),

    that is, the great circle distance from the kernel location :math:`\rho` to the
    probed location :math:`r`. If Friedel symmetry is assumed, the expression is instead

    .. math ::
        d(\rho, r) = \arctan_2(\Vert \rho \times r \Vert, \vert \rho \cdot r \vert)

    The normalization factor :math:`\rho_i` is given by

    .. math ::
        N_i = \sum_j \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d(\rho_i, \rho_j)}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right]

    where the sum goes over the coordinates of all grid points. This leads to an
    approximately even spherical function, such that a set of coefficients which are all equal
    is approximately isotropic, to the extent possible with respect to restrictions
    imposed by grid resolution and scale parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    probed_coordinates : ProbedCoordinates
        Optional. A container with the coordinates on the sphere probed at each detector segment by the
        experimental method. Its construction from the system geometry is method-dependent.
        By default, an empty instance of :class:`mumott.ProbedCoordinates` is created.
    grid_scale : int
        The size of the coordinate grid on the sphere. Denotes the number of azimuthal rings between the
        pole and the equator, where each ring has between ``2`` and ``2 * grid_scale`` points
        along the azimuth.
    kernel_scale_parameter : float
        The scale parameter of the kernel in units of :math:`\frac{\pi}{2 (g + 1)}`, where
        :math:`g` is ``grid_scale``.
    enforce_friedel_symmetry : bool
        If set to ``True``, Friedel symmetry will be enforced, using the assumption that points
        on opposite sides of the sphere are equivalent.
    kwargs
        Miscellaneous arguments which relate to segment integrations can be
        passed as keyword arguments:

            integration_mode
                 Mode to integrate line segments on the reciprocal space sphere. Possible options are
                 ``'simpson'``, ``'midpoint'``, ``'romberg'``, ``'trapezoid'``.
                 ``'simpson'``, ``'trapezoid'``, and ``'romberg'`` use adaptive
                 integration with the respective quadrature rule from ``scipy.integrate``.
                 ``'midpoint'`` uses a single mid-point approximation of the integral.
                 Default value is ``'simpson'``.
            n_integration_starting_points
                 Number of points used in the first iteration of the adaptive integration.
                 The number increases by the rule ``N`` &larr; ``2 * N - 1`` for each iteration.
                 Default value is 3.
            integration_tolerance
                 Tolerance for the maximum relative error between iterations before the integral
                 is considered converged. Default is ``1e-5``.
            integration_maxiter
                 Maximum number of iterations. Default is ``10``.
            enforce_sparsity
                 If ``True``, makes matrix sparse by limiting the number of basis set elements
                 that can map to each segment. Default is ``False``.
            sparsity_count
                 Number of basis set elements that can map to each segment,
                 if ``enforce_sparsity`` is set to ``True``. Default is ``3``.

        -----
        When solving an inverse problem, one should not attempt to optimize the
        coefficients directly using the gradient one obtains by applying this method to the data.
        Instead, one must either take the gradient of the residual between the
        :meth:`~.GaussianKernels.forward` computation of the coefficients and the data.
        Alternatively one can apply both the forward and the gradient computation to the
        coefficients to be optimized, and the gradient computation to the data, and treat
        the residual of the two as the gradient of the optimization coefficients. The approaches
        are algebraically equivalent, but one may be more efficient than the other in some
        circumstances. However, normally, the projection between detector and
        ``GaussianKernel`` space is only a small part of the overall computation,
        so there is typically not much to be gained from optimizing it.
