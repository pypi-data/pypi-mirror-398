Welcome to **Owl – Optimal Wealth Lab**, an open-source retirement-planning tool built with linear programming. Owl helps you explore and optimize long-term financial strategies such as withdrawals, contributions, Roth conversions, and legacy planning under various market assumptions.

- Use **historical return data** to back-test strategies.  
- Run **Monte Carlo simulations** with stochastic models to evaluate risk.  
- Build scenarios using **fixed or custom return assumptions**, inflation, and tax rules.  
- Optimize for **maximum net spending** or **after-tax bequest**, depending on your goals.  
- Incorporate tax-sensitive behavior including Roth conversions, IRMAA, and RMDs.  
- Fully customize inputs: accounts, spending paths, incomes, and time-series data.

# Quick Start

1. **Launch Owl**  
   - Use the hosted Streamlit interface at *owlplanner.streamlit.app*, or  
   - Run locally via Docker or directly from source.

2. **Set Up Your Profile**  
   - Enter your age, retirement horizon, and financial accounts (taxable, traditional, Roth).  
   - Add income sources such as salary or Social Security.  
   - Include planned future cash flows or large one-time expenses.

3. **Choose Your Assumptions**  
   - Select a return model: **historical**, **stochastic**, or **fixed**.  
   - Set inflation and rate assumptions, or import your own series.  
   - Define your spending approach: constant, rising, or “smile curve.”

4. **Pick Your Optimization Goal**  
   - **Maximize lifetime spending**, or  
   - **Maximize after-tax bequest** while maintaining desired spending levels.  
   - Add optional controls (e.g., Roth conversion caps, withdrawal constraints).

5. **Run the Optimization**  
   - Owl computes optimal withdrawals, conversions, and contribution paths.  
   - Review results: spending plan, account balances, and tax projections.

6. **Simulate Scenarios (Optional)**  
   - Use Monte Carlo simulation to test robustness.  
   - Explore “what-if” cases such as low returns, high inflation, or policy changes.

7. **Iterate and Refine**  
   - Adjust assumptions and re-run scenarios.  
   - Save or export results for comparison.
