bits
========

Bits is a tool to build, install and package large software stacks. It originates from the aliBuild tool, originally developed to simplify building and installing ALICE / ALFA software and attempts to make it more general and usable for other communities that share similar problems and have overlapping dependencies. It is under active development and subject to rapid changes and should NOT be used in production environment where stability and backward compatibility is important.

Instant gratification with::

 $ git clone git@github.com:bitsorg/bits.git; cd bits; export PATH=$PWD:$PATH; cd ..
 $ git clone git@github.com:bitsorg/alice.bits.git
 $ cd alice.bits
 $ git clone git@github.com:bitsorg/common.bits.git;

Review and customise bits.rc file (in particular, sw_dir location where all output will be stored)::

 $ cat bits.rc
 [bits]
 organisation=ALICE
 [ALICE]
 pkg_prefix=VO_ALICE
 sw_dir=../sw
 repo_dir=.
 search_path=common

Then::

 $ bits build ROOT
 $ bits enter ROOT/latest
 $ root -b

Pre-requisites
==============

If you are using bits directly from git clone, you should make sure
you have the dependencies installed. The easiest way to do this is to run::

    # Optional, make a venv so the dependencies are not installed globally
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -e .


Contributing
============


If you want to contribute to bits, you can run the tests with::

    # Optional, make a venv so the dependencies are not installed globally
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    pip install -e .[test] # Only needed once
    tox

The test suite only runs fully on a Linux system, but there is a reduced suite for macOS, runnable with::

    tox -e darwin

You can also run only the unit tests (it's a lot faster than the full suite) with::

    pytest

To run the documentation locally, you can use::

    # Optional, make a venv so the dependencies are not installed globally
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies for the docs, check pyproject.toml for more info
    pip install -e .[docs]

    # Run the docs
    cd docs
    mkdocs serve
