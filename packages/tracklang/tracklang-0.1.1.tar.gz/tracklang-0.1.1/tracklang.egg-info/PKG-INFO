# TrackLang

## A programming language* using TrackMania terminology

*TrackLang is a syntax-level wrapper around Python.*

---

## Overview

TrackLang is a domain-specific language that maps TrackMania-inspired terminology
to standard Python constructs.

TrackLang does not introduce new semantics, runtime behavior, or execution
models. All TrackLang programs are translated into valid Python and executed
using the Python interpreter.

If it works in Python, it works in TrackLang.

---

## Design Goals

- Preserve full Python semantics
- Avoid custom runtimes or interpreters
- Keep translation logic simple and transparent
- Remain honest about what the project is

---

## Non-Goals

TrackLang does not aim to:
- Improve performance
- Replace Python
- Introduce new language features
- Be suitable for production use

---

## Example

TrackLang source:

    START_RACE main():
        PB time = 3

        LOOP_TRACK time FASTER_THAN 0:
            CHAT time
            PB time = time - 1
        FINISH
    FINISH

    GO main()

Translated Python:

   ```python
        def main():
        time = 3
        while time > 0:
            print(time)
            time = time - 1

    main()
```
The programs are functionally identical.

## Syntax Overview

TrackLang replaces a small set of Python keywords with TrackMania-themed aliases.
All other syntax is standard Python.

### Control Flow

| TrackLang   | Python |
| ----------- | ------ |
| START_RACE  | def    |
| CHECKPOINT  | if     |
| ALT_ROUTE   | elif   |
| ELSE_ROUTE  | else   |
| LOOP_TRACK  | while  |
| LAP         | for    |
| FINISH      | end    |

### Statements

| TrackLang                                | Python              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| CHAT                                     | print             |
| PB x = y                                 | x = y             |
| GO f()                                   | f()               |
| RESTART_MAP                              | return            |
| DNF                                      | break             |
| RESET_RUN                                | continue          |
| INSTALLOPENPLANETPLUGIN {module}        | import {module}   |
| INSTALLOPENPLANETPLUGIN {module} AS {alias} | import {module} as {alias} |
| DOWNLOADFROMNADEO {module} {thing}      | from {module} import {thing} |

### Operators

| TrackLang    | Python |
| ------------ | ------ |
| FASTER_THAN  | >      |
| SLOWER_THAN  | <      |
| EQUALS       | ==     |
| NOT_PB       | !=     |
| AT_LEAST     | >=     |
| AT_MOST      | <=     |

## Indentation Model

TrackLang uses explicit block terminators.

- Blocks begin with control statements
- Blocks end with FINISH
- Indentation is generated automatically during translation

This removes whitespace sensitivity while preserving Python compatibility.

---

## Installation

    pip install tracklang

---

## Usage

    tracklang example.tm

---

## Limitations

- Errors originate from Python
- Debugging occurs in translated Python
- No sandboxing is provided

---

## Intended Use

TrackLang is intended for:
- Educational experiments
- Language tooling exploration
- Demonstrations
- Jokes taken seriously

It is not recommended for production systems.
Seriously. It isn't.
