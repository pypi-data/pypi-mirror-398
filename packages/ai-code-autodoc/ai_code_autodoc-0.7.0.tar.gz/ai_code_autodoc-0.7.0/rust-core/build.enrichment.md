## Enriched Entities

### Function: `main`

**Line:** 10

**Description:** The 'main' function serves as the entry point for executing the build process of a Rust extension module. It orchestrates the necessary steps to compile and prepare the Rust code for integration with Python.

**Purpose:** The primary purpose of the 'main' function is to initiate the build process for a Rust extension module, ensuring that all required components are correctly configured and compiled.

**Key Features:**
- Initiates the build process for Rust extensions
- Handles configuration settings for the build
- May invoke other functions or modules to manage the build lifecycle

**Usage Examples:**
```python
Running the script directly via the command line: `python build.py`
```
```python
Integrating the build process into a larger automation pipeline that requires Rust extensions
```
