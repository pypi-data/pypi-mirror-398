### Classes

#### `ChangeDetector` (line 62)
> The ChangeDetector class is designed to monitor and identify changes in files, facilitating incremental enrichment processes. It helps in tracking modifications to ensure that updates are efficiently applied without reprocessing unchanged data.

#### `FileChangeInfo` (line 25)
> The `FileChangeInfo` class is designed to encapsulate information regarding changes made to files, specifically for the purpose of incremental enrichment in a software system. It likely tracks attributes such as modified timestamps, change types, and potentially the content changes themselves to facilitate efficient updates.

#### `InlineEnricher` (line 245)
> The InlineEnricher class is designed to enhance Python code files by adding or updating docstrings directly within the code. This functionality aims to improve code documentation and maintainability by ensuring that functions and classes are well-documented inline.

#### `InlineEnrichmentResult` (line 44)
> The InlineEnrichmentResult class encapsulates the outcome of an inline enrichment operation, which typically involves augmenting data with additional context or information. It serves as a structured representation of the results obtained from such an enrichment process.

#### `ModuleEnrichmentGenerator` (line 569)
> The ModuleEnrichmentGenerator class is responsible for generating module-level enrichment files, which likely enhance or augment the documentation or metadata associated with specific modules in a codebase. It serves as a utility for automating the creation of these enrichment files based on predefined criteria or templates.
