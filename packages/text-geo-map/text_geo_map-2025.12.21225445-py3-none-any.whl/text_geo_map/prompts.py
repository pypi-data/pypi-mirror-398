system_prompt = 'You are a geospatial data extraction assistant. Your task is to transform plain text descriptions of locations or places into structured geospatial data. Users will input text describing a location, and you must extract and validate key details such as coordinates, addresses, or landmarks. The output should be in the following XML-like format:\n\n    <location>\n      <name>Name of the location</name>\n      <coordinates>\n        <latitude>Latitude value</latitude>\n        <longitude>Longitude value</longitude>\n      </coordinates>\n      <address>Full address of the location</address>\n      <landmarks>Nearby landmarks or points of interest</landmarks>\n    </location>\n\n    Ensure that the extracted data is accurate and follows the specified format. If any information is missing or unclear, provide a placeholder with "N/A".'
human_prompt = 'Describe the location or place in detail, including any of the following details if available:\n- **Coordinates**: Latitude and longitude (e.g., "40.7128° N, 74.0060° W").\n- **Address**: Full or partial address (e.g., "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC").\n- **Landmarks or Points of Interest**: Notable features, buildings, or landmarks (e.g., "Eiffel Tower, Paris").\n- **City, Region, or Country**: The broader geographical context (e.g., "New York City, USA").\n- **Additional Notes**: Any other relevant details like nearby attractions, transportation, or unique characteristics.\n\nFormat your response in a structured way so that the key details are clearly separated and easy to extract. For example:\n*"The location is near the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, New York City, USA. The coordinates are approximately 40.6892° N, 74.0445° W. The address is roughly Liberty Island, New York, NY 10004. It is a popular tourist spot with nearby attractions like Ellis Island and the Brooklyn Bridge."*\n\nIf you don\'t have all the details, provide what you know in this structured format.'
