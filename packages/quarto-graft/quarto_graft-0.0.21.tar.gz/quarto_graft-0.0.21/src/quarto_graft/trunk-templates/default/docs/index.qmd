Welcome to your Quarto Graft trunk! This page has three **graft collars** (insertion points where you can attach content from separate graft documents):

- `main` - "My Grafts" section
- `notes` - Notes
- `bugs` - Bugs

## Get Started

Create your first graft and add it to one of the collars above by referencing its collar name.

```
quarto-graft graft create
```

Happy writing!
