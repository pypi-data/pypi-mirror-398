# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed
- `is_token_expired` now returns `True` when token expiration time is unknown (previously returned `False`, which could cause `TokenExpiredError` on requests with stale tokens)
- Added automatic retry with token refresh on 401 responses - if server returns 401, client will attempt to refresh the token and retry the request once before raising `TokenExpiredError`

### Changed
- Token refresh is now more aggressive: tokens with unknown expiration time are treated as expired to ensure proactive refresh
