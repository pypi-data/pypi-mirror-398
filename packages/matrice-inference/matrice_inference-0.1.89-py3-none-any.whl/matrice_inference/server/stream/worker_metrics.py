"""
Worker-level metrics storage with thread-safe collection and aggregation.

This module provides a lightweight, thread-safe metrics collection class for
streaming workers. Supports both instance-level and CLASS-LEVEL (shared) metrics.

CLASS-LEVEL METRICS (threading-based workers):
    One WorkerMetrics instance shared across all workers of the same type.
    Accessed via WorkerMetrics.get_shared(worker_type) class method.
    Thread-safe with internal locking for concurrent worker access.
    Works for: consumer_manager, producer_worker (same process, different threads)

MULTIPROCESS METRICS (multiprocessing-based workers):
    For workers running in separate processes (inference, post_processing),
    metrics must be sent back to the main process via multiprocessing.Queue.
    Use MultiprocessWorkerMetrics for these workers.
    The main process aggregates metrics from all worker processes.

INSTANCE-LEVEL METRICS (legacy):
    Each worker has its own WorkerMetrics instance.
    Maintained for backward compatibility and testing.

class WorkerMetrics:
    """
    Thread-safe metrics storage for worker instances.
    
    Supports two modes:
    1. INSTANCE MODE: Each worker creates its own WorkerMetrics (legacy)
    2. SHARED MODE: All workers of same type share one WorkerMetrics (new)
    
    SHARED MODE DESIGN:
        - One WorkerMetrics per worker_type stored in class-level registry
        - Workers access via WorkerMetrics.get_shared(worker_type)
        - All operations are thread-safe with internal locking
        - Transparent to worker code - still use self.metrics.record_*()
    
    Thread Safety:
        All public methods acquire internal lock before state modification.
        Lock is reentrant (RLock) to support nested calls if needed.
        Snapshot operation is atomic - no data corruption during collection.
    
    Memory Management:
        Shared mode significantly reduces memory overhead:
        - Instance mode: 4 workers × 1000 samples = 4000 floats
        - Shared mode: 1 shared × 1000 samples = 1000 floats (75% reduction)
    
    Backward Compatibility:
        Existing code using WorkerMetrics(worker_id, worker_type) continues
        to work unchanged. To use shared mode, workers call get_shared().
