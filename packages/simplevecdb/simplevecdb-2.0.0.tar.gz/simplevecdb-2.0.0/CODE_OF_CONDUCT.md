# Code of Conduct

## Our Community

SimpleVecDB is a welcoming, collaborative open-source project. We're here to build useful software together and help each other learn.

## Guidelines

**Be respectful and constructive:**

- Treat others with kindness and professionalism
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Provide constructive feedback on code and ideas
- Assume good intentions and give people the benefit of the doubt

**Don't be a jerk:**

- No harassment, personal attacks, or trolling
- Keep discussions focused on the project
- Respect people's time and contributions
- Don't spam or promote unrelated content

## Resolving Issues

Most issues can be resolved through respectful dialogue. If you experience or witness behavior that makes the community unwelcoming:

1. **Address it directly** (if comfortable): Sometimes a friendly clarification is all that's needed
2. **Report it**: Contact coderdayton14@gmail.com with details
3. **We'll respond**: Typically within 72 hours with next steps

Serious or repeated violations may result in temporary or permanent removal from the project.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, and any official communication channels.
