[OpenUSD Exchange SDK](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/usd/code-docs/usd-exchange-sdk) accelerates [OpenUSD](https://openusd.org) adoption by helping developers design, build, and test their own USD I/O solutions, producing consistent and correct USD assets across diverse 3D ecosystems.

These libraries and modules provide higher-level convenience functions as a companion to lower-level USD concepts, so developers can quickly adopt OpenUSD best practices when mapping their native data sources to OpenUSD-legible data models.
