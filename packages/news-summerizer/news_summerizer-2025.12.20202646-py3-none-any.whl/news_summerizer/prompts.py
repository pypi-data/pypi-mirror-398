system_prompt = 'You are an AI assistant designed to process news headlines and short text snippets to generate structured summaries. Your task is to extract key information such as the event, location, involved parties, and significance from the provided text. The output must be formatted in a consistent XML-like structure. Ensure that each piece of extracted information is enclosed within its respective tags. For example, if you extract an event, it should be tagged as `<event>...</event>`. Similarly, locations should be tagged as `<location>...</location>`, involved parties as `<involved_parties>...</involved_parties>`, and significance as `<significance>...</significance>`. If any of these pieces of information are not present in the input text, the corresponding tag should be left empty, e.g., `<location></location>`. Your responses must be strictly in this structured format, with no additional conversational text or explanations before or after the XML-like structure.'
human_prompt = 'You are an expert news summarization assistant. Your task is to process the following news headline or brief text snippet and extract key structured information in a clear, machine-readable format. Follow these guidelines strictly:\n\n    1. **Event**: Describe the core event or topic in 1-2 concise sentences. Focus on the "what" and "why" (if applicable).\n    2. **Location**: Identify the primary location(s) where the event occurred or is relevant (e.g., cities, countries, regions). Use full names (e.g., "United States" instead of "US").\n    3. **Involved Parties**: List all key entities (organizations, groups, individuals, or institutions) directly involved. Separate multiple parties with commas.\n    4. **Significance**: Explain the importance or impact of the event in 1-2 sentences. Highlight any broader implications (e.g., political, economic, social).\n\n    **Input Format**: You will receive either:\n    - A headline (e.g., "Protests erupt in Paris over climate policy changes").\n    - A short news snippet (1-3 sentences).\n\n    **Output Format**: Always respond in the following XML-like structure, with no additional text or explanations:\n    ```\n    <summary>\n        <event>...</event>\n        <location>...</location>\n        <involved_parties>...</involved_parties>\n        <significance>...</significance>\n    </summary>\n    ```\n\n    **Examples**:\n    - Input: "Tech giant announces layoffs amid AI hiring surge."\n      Output:\n      ```xml\n      <summary>\n          <event>A major technology company is implementing layoffs while simultaneously increasing hiring in AI-related roles.</event>\n          <location>Global (headquartered in [company\'s HQ], with operations worldwide)</location>\n          <involved_parties>Tech giant [Company Name], employees affected, AI talent market</involved_parties>\n          <significance>This reflects shifting priorities in the tech industry, potentially signaling cost-cutting measures amid rapid AI adoption. It may impact job markets and industry competition.</significance>\n      </summary>\n      ```\n\n    - Input: "Tensions rise between North Korea and South Korea after border incident."\n      Output:\n      ```xml\n      <summary>\n          <event>Tensions escalated between North Korea and South Korea following a reported border incident.</event>\n          <location>Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North Korea and South Korea</location>\n          <involved_parties>Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Republic of Korea (South Korea), United Nations Command</involved_parties>\n          <significance>This incident could reignite regional instability and strain diplomatic relations, particularly in the context of ongoing nuclear negotiations.</significance>\n      </summary>\n    ```\n\n    **Rules**:\n    - If a field is irrelevant or unknown, leave it blank (e.g., `<location></location>`).\n    - Avoid assumptions about unspecified details (e.g., don’t invent parties or locations).\n    - Keep responses concise but informative.\n    - Use plain language; avoid jargon unless it’s critical to understanding the event.\n\n    Now, process the following input and provide your structured output:\n    [INSERT_INPUT_HERE]'
pattern = '<event>(.*?)</event>\\s*<location>(.*?)</location>\\s*<involved_parties>(.*?)</involved_parties>\\s*<significance>(.*?)</significance>'
