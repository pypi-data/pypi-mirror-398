### 👋 Hi there, I'm **Young Joon Lee (이영준)**

🎓 Associate Professor of Artificial Intelligence
💼 Chief Innovation Officer
🌍 Regional Innovation & Global AI Education Leader

🧠 About Me

I’m an educator, researcher, and innovator at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Financial Economics**.
My mission is to connect **cutting-edge AI research** with real-world challenges — developing models that reason ethically, explain transparently, and serve humanity responsibly.

🔬 Research Focus

- **Large Language Models & Knowledge Graphs** — advancing _Agentic AI_ and Socratic reasoning architectures
- **NLP for Economic & Financial Analysis** — measuring policy effects through sentiment and media signals
- **Ethical AI** — frameworks for fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI systems
- **Behavioral Economics-Inspired AI** — modeling rational and bounded-rational decision systems

🚀 Leadership & Flagship Projects

🦾 AI-Based Autonomous Road Repair Robot

Leading a consortium with **Seoul National University**, **KAIST**, and **RovoRoad** to build the world’s first **AI-powered autonomous road repair system**, integrating visual intelligence, robotics, and predictive maintenance.
_(Source: Yonhap News, Sept 2025)_

🧩 Agentic AI-Based Intelligent Education Platform

Directing a 4-way collaboration (**Cheju Halla University × Saltlux × Yonsei University × KAIST**) to create a next-generation learning system using **trustworthy, dialogic AI** for human-AI co-reasoning.
_(Source: News Jeju, Sept 2025)_

🌐 KOICA–TIU–Cheju Halla AI Training Center (Uzbekistan)

Project Director for KOICA’s first **AI Education Center** in Central Asia, training over 100 local educators and engineers in ethical AI, GenAI, and data literacy.
_(Source: NewsNJeju, Aug 2025)_

💻 Sustainable Transition with AI (STAI)

Leading a global workshop series linking **AI, ESG, and climate resilience**, fostering sustainable innovation strategies for public and private sectors.

🌄 Jeju AI Computing & Innovation Ecosystem

Establishing the **Jeju AI Innovation Cluster** through partnerships with **ESTsoft**, **AWS**, **Saltlux**, and regional industries to nurture next-generation AI professionals and startups.

📊 Economic Research & Media Impact

My interdisciplinary work integrates **AI-based text mining** and **monetary policy analysis**, exploring how linguistic tone in central-bank communications affects financial markets.
In **August 2025**, _AjuNews_ featured my joint research on _“News-Based Monetary Policy Surprises.”_
The study showed that **tone shifts in monetary policy news**—not just interest-rate changes—trigger measurable moves in bond yields and credit spreads, influencing both investor and consumer expectations.

This line of research highlights how **AI and NLP can reveal latent economic signals**, providing policymakers and analysts with new tools for real-time macroeconomic insight.

🎓 Education & Mentorship

- Designing **AI curricula** blending rigorous theory with applied innovation
- Mentoring students in **LLM fine-tuning, NLP system design, and AI ethics**
- Leading **cross-cultural AI education initiatives** in Jeju, Uzbekistan, and beyond

💡 Core Values

I believe that **innovation** must be human-centered and value-driven.
Every research and teaching initiative I lead is guided by **empathy**, ensuring that technology amplifies inclusion rather than inequality.
I pursue **collaboration** across academia, industry, and government to turn ideas into impact.
And I remain committed to **sustainability**—designing AI systems and educational ecosystems that endure ethically and socially.

🌏 Vision

To redefine the future of **education, finance, and sustainability** through **ethical AI innovation**—building technologies that not only think intelligently but **act responsibly**.
