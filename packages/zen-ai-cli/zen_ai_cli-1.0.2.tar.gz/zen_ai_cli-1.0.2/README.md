## Important Notice
This is a work in progress for my Jugend Forscht project. 
You currently can't use it without running your own Zen AI backend server which isn't publicly available yet.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Authentication** — Secure login/signup with session persistence
- 💬 **Chat** — Interactive AI conversations with markdown support
- 📝 **Notes** — Create, edit, search, and manage your notes
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** — Rich terminal interface with colors and arrow-key navigation

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install zen-cli
```

## 🚀 Usage

Simply run:

```bash
zen
```

Navigate with arrow keys (↑↓) and press Enter to select.

## ⚙️ Configuration

By default, Zen CLI connects to `http://localhost:5000`. 

To use a different server, create a `.env` file:

```env
ZEN_API_URL=https://your-zen-server.com
```

Or set the environment variable directly.
