## Overview

**Uniquant** is an asynchronous Python library that provides a unified, high-performance interface to interact with multiple cryptocurrency trading platforms. Built with `asyncio` and `aiohttp`, it currently supports **Binance Spot** public REST APIs, enabling developers to build scalable, non-blocking applications for market data retrieval.

The library abstracts platform-specific complexities into a clean, consistent API—ideal for research, data analysis, or prototyping—while adhering to asynchronous best practices.

> **Note**: Private API support and additional exchanges are planned for future releases (see [Roadmap](https://github.com/Broo-DevX-Coder/Uniquant/wiki/Roadmap)).

---

## Features

- Asynchronous, non-blocking I/O using `asyncio` and `aiohttp`
- Unified API design for cross-exchange compatibility (currently **Binance Spot public endpoints only**)
- Lightweight with minimal dependencies
- Type hints for improved developer experience and IDE support
- Automatic rate-limit handling (basic)

---

## Technologies & Dependencies

- **Python**: 3.9 or higher
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `asyncio` (built-in)
  - `aiohttp` (for async HTTP requests)
  - `websockets` (for real time connections and messages -system of exchanges-)
---

## Installation

Install Uniquant via `pip`:

```bash
pip install uniquant
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Broo-DevX-Coder/Uniquant
cd uniquant
pip install -e .
```

> Ensure you are using Python 3.9+.

---

## Usage

### Public Market Data (Binance Spot)

```python
from uniquant.Platforms.Binance.Public import PublicSymbols,OneSymbole # You can to chow any sepported exchange
from uniquant.main.utils import QueueStream,STABLECOINS_USD # These are just utils from lib
import aiohttp

async def main():
    OBJ = PublicSymbols(symbol="BTCUSDT")
    await OBJ.start(aiohttp.ClientSession()) # This function is very imporetant to initialyze sessions, you can set a costimize aiohttp.ClientSession for them
    async for ob in OBJ.orderbook_stream(limit=int): # this is a small exemple to get async-generator of orderbook
      print(ob)

asyncio.run(main())
```

> All sepported exchanges objects and functions are same
> **Important**: You can to see all docs of use in [wiki DOCs](https://github.com/Broo-DevX-Coder/Uniquant/wiki/DOCs)
