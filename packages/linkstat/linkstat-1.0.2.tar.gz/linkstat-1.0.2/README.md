_linkstat_ is a script that verifies the connectivity of links documented in the documentation. By detecting broken links early, it maintains the integrity of the documentation.  
Currently, only Markdown files (*.md) are supported.

## Caution
This library accesses services during runtime, so executing it in large quantities will cause load on the target service. When performing functional verification or integrating into CI/CD, please ensure the load on the linked service is minimized as much as possible.

pip install linkstat
```

## Usage

linkstat {source_file_or_directory}
```
