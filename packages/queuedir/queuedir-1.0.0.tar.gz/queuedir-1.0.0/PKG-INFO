# QueueDir

A lightweight, cross-platform folder-based job queue system. Monitors an input folder and executes a script for each file that appears.

## Installation

```bash
pip install queuedir
```

## Usage

```bash
queuedir --watch /path/to/inbox --script /path/to/process.sh
```

### Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--watch` | `-w` | Folder to monitor (required) | - |
| `--script` | `-s` | Script to execute (required) | - |
| `--done-dir` | | Destination for processed files | `{watch}/done` |
| `--failed-dir` | | Destination for failed files | `{watch}/failed` |
| `--timeout` | | Script timeout in seconds | 1200 |
| `--poll-interval` | | File stability check interval | 2 |
| `--once` | | Process existing files and exit | - |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Enable debug logging | - |

### Example

```bash
# Monitor inbox, run process.py for each file
queuedir -w ./inbox -s ./process.py -v

# Process existing files once and exit
queuedir -w ./inbox -s ./process.sh --once
```

## How It Works

1. Files dropped into the watched folder are detected
2. QueueDir waits for the file to stabilize (no longer being written)
3. The configured script is executed with the file path as argument
4. On success (exit 0): file moves to `done/`
5. On failure (non-zero exit): file moves to `failed/`

## Script Requirements

Your script receives the file path as the first argument:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
filepath="$1"
echo "Processing: $filepath"
# ... do work ...
exit 0  # success
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
filepath = sys.argv[1]
print(f"Processing: {filepath}")
# ... do work ...
sys.exit(0)  # success
```
