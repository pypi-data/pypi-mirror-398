## Python wrapper for Homeassistant's [Websocket API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/websocket/) and [REST API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/)

> Note: As of [this comment](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/discussions/1074#discussioncomment-9196867) the REST API is not getting any new features or endpoints.
> However, it is not going to be deprecated according to [this comment](https://github.com/home-assistant/developers.home-assistant/pull/2150#pullrequestreview-2017433583)
> But it is recommended to use the Websocket API for new integrations.

### REST API Examples

```py
from homeassistant_api import Client

with Client(
    '<API Server URL>', # i.e. 'http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/'
    '<Your Long Lived Access-Token>'
) as client:
    light = client.trigger_service('light', 'turn_on', entity_id="light.living_room")
```

All the methods also support async/await!
Just prefix the method with `async_` and pass the `use_async=True` argument to the `Client` constructor.
Then you can use the methods as coroutines
(i.e. `await light.async_turn_on(...)`).

```py
import asyncio
from homeassistant_api import Client

async def main():
    with Client(
        '<REST API Server URL>', # i.e. 'http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/'
        '<Your Long Lived Access-Token>',
        use_async=True
    ) as client:
    light = await client.async_trigger_service('light', 'turn_on', entity_id="light.living_room")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Websocket API Example

```py
from homeassistant_api import WebsocketClient

with WebsocketClient(
    '<WS API Server URL>', # i.e. 'ws://homeassistant.local:8123/api/websocket'
    '<Your Long Lived Access-Token>'
) as ws_client:
    light = ws_client.trigger_service('light', 'turn_on', entity_id="light.living_room")
```

> Note: The Websocket API is not yet supported in async/await mode.

## Documentation

All documentation, API reference, contribution guidelines and pretty much everything else
you'd want to know is on our readthedocs site [here](https://homeassistantapi.readthedocs.io)

If there is something missing, open an issue and let us know! Thanks!

Go make some cool stuff! Maybe come back and tell us about it in a
[discussion](https://github.com/GrandMoff100/HomeAssistantAPI/discussions)?
We'd love to hear about how you use our library!!
