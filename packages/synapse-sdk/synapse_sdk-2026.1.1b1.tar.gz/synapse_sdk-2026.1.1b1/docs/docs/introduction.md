# Synapse SDK

Build ML and data processing plugins.

## Overview

Synapse SDK is..

### Key Features

- **Plugin Development and Testing**: Develop modular, reusable components organized by categories for Synapse
- **Distributed Computing**: Built for scalable, distributed execution
- **Multiple Execution Modes**: Support for Jobs, Tasks, and REST APIs
- **Isolated Runtime Environments**: Each plugin runs in its own environment with dependency management
- **Progress Tracking**: Built-in progress monitoring and metrics reporting

### Plugin Categories

The SDK organizes plugins into specific categories:

1. **Neural Network** (`NEURAL_NET`): ML model training, inference, and deployment
2. **Export** (`EXPORT`): Data export and transformation operations
3. **Upload** (`UPLOAD`): File and data upload functionality
4. **Smart Tools** (`SMART_TOOL`): Intelligent automation tools
5. **Post-Annotation** (`POST_ANNOTATION`): Post-processing after data annotation
6. **Pre-Annotation** (`PRE_ANNOTATION`): Pre-processing before data annotation
7. **Data Validation** (`DATA_VALIDATION`): Data quality and validation checks
