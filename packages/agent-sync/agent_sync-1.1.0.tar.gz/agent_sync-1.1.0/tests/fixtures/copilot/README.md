# Copilot Agent Fixtures

## official-pr-reviewer.agent.md

This fixture represents a standard "PR Reviewer" agent often cited in GitHub Copilot Agent documentation and examples (e.g., `@pr-reviewer-agent`).

It demonstrates:
- Use of the `.agent.md` extension.
- YAML frontmatter with `tools` as a list.
- Use of `argument-hint` (Copilot specific).
- Structured Markdown body with clear purpose and instructions.

Source inspiration: GitHub Copilot Agents documentation and examples found via web search (e.g. `Code-and-Sorts/awesome-copilot-agents`).
