# namel3ss
Build AI-native applications in plain English.

namel3ss (pronounced nameless) is an English-first, AI-native programming language, built from the ground up to support AI. Everything your app needs — **data, UI, backend logic, and AI** — lives together in one `.ai` file. You describe what your system is and what it should do. namel3ss makes it executable.

- [What you can build today](docs/what-you-can-build-today.md)

## Why namel3ss
Modern application development is fragmented.

One stack for the backend.  
Another for the UI.  
A separate pile for prompts, agents, memory, tool calling, orchestration, tracing.

namel3ss removes the glue. It keeps the program **readable**, the runtime **deterministic**, and AI **explicit and inspectable**.

---

## What makes it different
- **One file** can define data models, UI pages, flows, and AI behavior.
- **Deterministic by design**. AI is the only non-deterministic boundary — and it’s explicit.
- **Inspectable AI**: memory, tools, and traces are visible.
- **A real toolchain**: CLI, formatter, linter, Studio.
- **If it’s hard to understand, it’s wrong.**

## Language · Runtime · Memory · Studio

### Language
Intent-driven syntax that reads like thought.
```ai
page "home":
  title is "Hello"
  text is "Hello World"
```
Record fields use `is` for types and `must` for constraints; canonical types are `text`, `number`, and `boolean` (e.g. `field "email" is text must be present`).

### Runtime
A unified runtime that behaves consistently across AI providers.
```ai
ai "assistant":
  provider is "openai"
  model is "gpt-4.1"
  system_prompt is "You are a helpful assistant."

flow "reply":
  ask ai "assistant" with input: input.message as reply
  return reply
```

### Memory
Explicit memory with configurable recall.
```ai
ai "assistant":
  provider is "openai"
  model is "gpt-4.1"
  memory:
    short_term is 10
    semantic is true
    profile is true
```

### Studio
A visual environment for building with namel3ss. Coming soon.
```
Studio
Coming soon.

## 10-second demo
```bash
pip install namel3ss
n3 new crud
n3 crud/app.ai studio
```
You just generated a working app and opened Studio to run it, inspect state, and see traces.

## Try it in 60 seconds
```bash
pip install namel3ss
n3 new crud my_app
n3 my_app/app.ai studio
```

---

## The Rule of 3
The “3” in namel3ss is not decoration. It’s a promise.

If you cannot understand the basics of namel3ss in 3 minutes, we consider that a design failure — and we will redesign it.

---

## What you can build today
CRUD dashboards (records → forms/tables → validation). Internal tools and admin panels. AI assistants over your records (with memory and traces). Multi-agent workflows (sequential + parallel orchestration). Prototypes that stay readable as they grow.

---

## What’s intentionally missing
namel3ss is focused. Some things are not here yet — on purpose. Before using it for production systems, read the [known limitations](resources/limitations.md).

## Quickstart
- [Quickstart guide](docs/quickstart.md)
- [Examples](examples/)
- [Examples you can run](#examples-you-can-run)
- [Learning book](resources/books/learning_namel3ss_v0.1.0.md)
- More links are listed below.

## Examples you can run
- CRUD dashboard: [docs/examples/demo_crud_dashboard.md](docs/examples/demo_crud_dashboard.md)
- Onboarding flow: [docs/examples/demo_onboarding_flow.md](docs/examples/demo_onboarding_flow.md)
- AI assistant over records: [docs/examples/demo_ai_assistant_over_records.md](docs/examples/demo_ai_assistant_over_records.md)

---

## Core CLI (file-first)
Run an app:
```bash
n3 app.ai
```
Validate:
```bash
n3 app.ai check
```
UI manifest and actions:
```bash
n3 app.ai ui
n3 app.ai actions
```
Run Studio:
```bash
n3 app.ai studio
```
Format and lint:
```bash
n3 app.ai format
n3 app.ai lint
```

---

## Providers and secrets
namel3ss supports local and cloud providers (including Ollama and Tier-1 cloud providers). Secrets should not be stored in `.ai`. Use environment variables or a local `.env` file next to `app.ai`. Templates generated by `n3 new` include `.gitignore` rules to keep `.env` out of git.

---

## Status
namel3ss is v0.1.0a1. It is stable enough for early adopters, prototypes, internal tools, and learning — and it is evolving fast.

---

## Alpha testers wanted
namel3ss is in early alpha. Breaking changes will happen. Documentation may lag.

If you like testing early systems and giving honest, technical feedback, we want your input.

**Try these three things**
1. Run the simplest example (or scaffold `n3 new crud`) and note anything unclear or broken.
2. Change a small flow or syntax and see how the runtime responds; report surprises.
3. Call an AI profile with a basic prompt and share any errors or friction you hit.
