- Uses `narwhals` as dataframe layer `binscatter`.
  - Currently supports: pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Dask, and PySpark
  - All other Narwhals backends fall back to a generic quantile handler if a native path is unavailable
- Lightweight - little dependencies
- Uses `plotly` as graphics backend - because: (1) its great (2) it uses `narwhals` as well, minimizing dependencies
- Pythonic alternative to the excellent **binsreg** package

## Example

We made this noisy scatterplot:

![Noisy scatterplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthiaskaeding/binscatter/images/images/readme/scatter.png)

This is how we make a nice binscatter plot, controlling for a set of features:

```python
from binscatter import binscatter

p_binscatter_controls = binscatter(
    df,
    "mtr90_lag3",
    "lnpat",
    [
        "top_corp_lag3",
        "real_gdp_pc",
        "population_density",
        "rd_credit_lag3",
        "statenum",
        "year",
    ],
    num_bins=35,
)
```

## Tests

- Run the full backend matrix, including PySpark: `just test`
- Use the faster run without PySpark: `just test-fast`
