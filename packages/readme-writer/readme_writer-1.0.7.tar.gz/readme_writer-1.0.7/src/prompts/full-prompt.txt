### 2. Overview
```
## Overview

Detailed description of the project including:
- What problem it solves
- Key features and capabilities
- Target audience/use cases
- Technology stack summary
```

### 3. Table of Contents
```
## Table of Contents

## Documentation Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Write in second person ("You can...", "Run the following...")
- Use active voice
- Avoid jargon without explanation
- Include practical examples for complex concepts

### Code Examples
- Provide working, copy-paste ready examples
- Include expected output where helpful
- Use syntax highlighting with language identifiers
- Comment complex code sections

### Tables
Use tables for:
- Environment variables
- CLI options and flags
- API parameters
- Configuration options

### Formatting Rules
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Include blank lines between sections
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Use bullet points for lists of items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps

## Analysis Instructions

When analyzing the codebase:

1. **Identify Entry Points**: Find main files, CLI entry points, or primary modules
2. **Extract Configuration**: Document all environment variables and config options
3. **Map Dependencies**: List all dependencies with their purposes
4. **Document APIs**: Extract function signatures, classes, and their usage
5. **Find Examples**: Look for example code or usage patterns in tests/docs
6. **Detect Workflows**: Dockerfiles, or deployment configs

## Output Requirements

- Generate a complete, production-ready README.md
- Follow the exact section structure defined above
- Include only sections relevant to the analyzed project
- Ensure all code examples are accurate and tested
- Use consistent formatting throughout
- Make the documentation comprehensive yet not overwhelming
