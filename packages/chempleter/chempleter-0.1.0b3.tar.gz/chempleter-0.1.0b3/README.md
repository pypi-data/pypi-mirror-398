# Chempleter

Chempleter is lightweight generative model which utlises a simple Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to predict syntactically valid extensions of a provided molecular fragment.
It accepts SMILES notation as input and enforces chemical syntax validity using SELFIES for the generated molecules.

* Why was Chempleter made?
    * Mainly for me to get into Pytorch. Also, I find it fun to generate random, possibly unsynthesisable molecules from a starting structure.

* What can Chempleter do?
    
    * Currently, Chempleter accepts an intial molecule/molecular fragment in SMILES format and generates a larger molecule with that intial structure included, while respecting chemical syntax. It also shows some interesting descriptors.
    
    * It can be used to generate a wide range of structural analogs which the share same core structure (by changing the sampling temperature) or decorate a core scaffold iteratively (by increasing generated token lengths)

    * In the future, it might be adapated to predict structures with a specific chemical property using a regressor to rank predictions and transition towards more "goal-directed" predictions.


## Prerequisites
* Python ">=3.13"
* See [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) for dependencies.
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (optional but recommended)

## Get started


You can install chempleter using any one of the following ways:

- #### Install from PyPi

    ``python -m pip install chempleter``

    By default, the CPU version of pytorch will be installed. Alternatively, you can install a PyTorch version compatible with your CUDA version by following the [Pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

- #### Install using uv

    1. Clone this repo

        ``git clone https://github.com/davistdaniel/chempleter.git``

    2. Inside the project directory, exceute in a terminal:

        ``uv sync``

        By default, the CPU version of pytorch will be installed, in case of using GPU as accelerator and CUDA 12.8:

        ``uv sync --extra gpu128``

        Alternatively, you can install a PyTorch version compatible with your CUDA version by following the [Pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).


    

### Usage

#### GUI
* To start the Chempleter GUI:
    
    ``chempleter-gui``

    or 

    ``uv run src/chempleter/gui.py``


* Type in the SMILES notation for the starting structure or leave it empty to generate random molecules. Click on ``GENERATE`` button to generate a molecule.
* Options:
    * Temperature : Increasing the temperature would result in more unusual molecules, while lower values would generate more common structures.
    * Sampling : `Most probable` selects the molecule with the highest likelihood for the given starting structure, producing the same result on repeated generations. `Random` generates a new molecule each time, while still including the input structure.


#### As a python library

* To use Chempleter as a python library:

    ```python
    from chempleter.inference import extend
    generated_mol, generated_smiles, generated_selfies = extend(smiles="c1ccccc1")
    print(generated_smiles)
    >> C1=CC=CC=C1C2=CC=C(CN3C=NC4=CC=CC=C4C3=O)O2
    ```

    To draw the generated molecule :

    ```python
    from rdkit import Chem
    Chem.Draw.MolToImage(generated_mol)
    ```
* For details on available parameters, refer to the ``extend`` (``chempleter.inference`` module) function’s docstring.

### Current model performance

Performance metrics were evaluated across 500 independent generations using a model checkpoint trained for 80 epochs with a batch size of 64.

| Metric     | Value | Description                                                                                                  |
|------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Validity   | 1.0   | Proportion of Generated SMILES which respect chemical syntax; tested using selfies decoder and RDkit parser. |
| Uniqueness | 0.96  | Proportion of Generated SMILES which were unique                                                             |
| Novelty    | 0.85  | Proportion of Generated SMILES which were not present in the training datatset                             |

## Random Notes

* Training data
    * QM9 and ZINC datasets. 379997 molecules were used for training in total.
* Running wihout a GPU
    * Chempleter uses a 2-layer GRU, it should run comfortably on a CPU.
