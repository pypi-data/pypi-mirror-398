# GitHub Contribution Writer

A command-line tool that draws words and text on your GitHub contribution graph by generating commits with strategically backdated timestamps.

## How It Works

GitHub's contribution graph is a 7-row by 52-column grid representing your commit activity over the past year. Each cell corresponds to a specific day, with the color intensity reflecting the number of contributions made on that day.

This tool maps text characters to a 5x7 pixel font grid, calculates the corresponding calendar dates, and generates Git commits with backdated timestamps. When pushed to GitHub, these commits render as readable text on your contribution graph.

```

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install github-contribution-writer
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dinesh-git17/github-contribution-writer.git
cd github-contribution-writer
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Preview what commits will be generated:

```bash
contribution-writer "HELLO" --year 2025 --dry-run
```

Generate commits for a word:

```bash
contribution-writer "HELLO" --year 2025
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `word` | The text to render (A-Z, 0-9, space) | Required |
| `--year` | Target year for the commits | 2025 |
| `--dry-run` | Preview without creating commits | False |
| `--no-center` | Align text to start of year | False (centered) |
| `--intensity` | Commits per pixel (1-10) | 5 |

### Examples

Render text centered on 2025:

```bash
contribution-writer "DINESH" --year 2025
```

Render text at the beginning of the year with maximum intensity:

```bash
contribution-writer "HI" --year 2025 --no-center --intensity 10
```

Preview the output before generating:

```bash
contribution-writer "CODE" --year 2025 --dry-run
```

## Pushing to GitHub

After generating commits, push them to a GitHub repository:

```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub first, then:
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

The contribution graph updates within a few minutes of pushing.

## Technical Details

### Font Specifications

- Character dimensions: 5 pixels wide, 7 pixels tall
- Character spacing: 1 pixel
- Supported characters: A-Z, 0-9, space
- Maximum text length: approximately 8 characters (limited by 52-week display)

### Commit Generation

Commits are created using Git's `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` and `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` environment variables to set custom timestamps. Each "pixel" in the rendered text corresponds to one or more commits on that date, with the intensity parameter controlling the exact count.

### Date Mapping

The contribution graph displays:
- Rows: Days of the week (Sunday at top, Saturday at bottom)
- Columns: Weeks of the year (oldest on left, newest on right)

Text is rendered by mapping each pixel position to a calendar date and generating the appropriate number of commits for that date.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git installed and configured
- A GitHub account with a public repository

## Limitations

- Only uppercase letters A-Z, digits 0-9, and spaces are supported
- Text longer than 8 characters may not fit within the 52-week display window
- The contribution graph only shows the past year, so backdated commits must fall within this range
- Private repositories do not contribute to the public contribution graph by default
