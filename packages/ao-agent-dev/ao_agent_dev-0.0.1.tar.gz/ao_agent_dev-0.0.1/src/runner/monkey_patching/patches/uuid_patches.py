"""
UUID monkey patches for taint tracking.

This module provides patches for Python's UUID class to enable taint tracking
for UUID operations. When applied, UUID methods will return TaintWrapper objects
with position tracking information for security analysis.

The patches modify the following UUID methods:
- hex: Returns the UUID as a 32-character hexadecimal TaintWrapper
- __str__: Returns the UUID as a formatted string with dashes as TaintWrapper
- __repr__: Returns the UUID's repr as TaintWrapper

All returned strings include Position objects that track the entire string
as containing random/sensitive data for security analysis purposes.
