## Features

* **CST-safe removals:** Uses LibCST to remove selected imports or functions (handles multiline imports, aliases, decorators, async etc..)
* **Framework-Aware Detection**: Attempt at handling Flask, Django, FastAPI routes and decorators  
* **Test File Exclusion**: Auto excludes test files (you can include it back if you want)
* **Interactive Cleanup**: Select specific items to remove from CLI
* **Unused Functions & Methods**: Finds functions and methods that not called
* **Unused Classes**: Detects classes that are not instantiated or inherited
* **Unused Imports**: Identifies imports that are not used
* **Folder Management**: Inclusion/exclusion of directories 
* **Ignore Pragmas**: Skip lines tagged with `# pragma: no skylos`, `# pragma: no cover`, or `# noqa`
* **Secrets Scanning (PoC, opt-in)**: Detects API keys & secrets (GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Stripe, AWS, Google, SendGrid, Twilio, private key blocks)
* **Dangerous Patterns**: Flags risky code such as `eval/exec`, `os.system`, `subprocess(shell=True)`, `pickle.load/loads`, `yaml.load` without SafeLoader, hashlib.md5/sha1. Refer to `DANGEROUS_CODE.md` for the whole list. This includes SQL injection, path traversal and any other security flaws that may arise from the practise of vibe-coding. 
* **Coverage Integration**: Auto-detects `.coverage` files to verify dead code with runtime data
* **Implicit Reference Detection**: Catches dynamic patterns like `getattr(mod, f"handle_{x}")`, framework decorators (`@app.route`, `@pytest.fixture`), and f-string dispatch patterns

## Benchmark (You can find this benchmark test in `test` folder)

The benchmark checks how well static analysis tools spot dead code in Python. Things such as unused functions, classes, imports, variables, that kinda stuff. To read more refer down below.

**The methodology and process for benchmarking can be found in `BENCHMARK.md`**

## Installation

### Basic Installation

```bash
pip install skylos
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos.git
cd skylos

pip install .
```

## Quick Start

So there's essentially 2 routes for you. If you have tests? Use `--coverage` for even better results. No tests? It's ok, just run the skylos command below as per usual. Key commands are marked with `(*)`

```bash
skylos /path/to/your/project ## pure dead code scan, does not include quality, danger etc

* skylos /path/to/your/project --coverage # With runtime verification (runs tests first)

skylos /path/to/your/project --secrets  ## include api key scan
skylos /path/to/your/project --danger   ## include safety scan for dangerous code
skylos /path/to/your/project --quality ## include quality scan for complex code

* skylos /path/to/your/project --secrets --danger --quality  ## you can string all the flags together
* skylos /path/to/your/project --danger --quality --audit --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001  ## if u want to add a LLM 
skylos /path/to/your/project --danger --quality --audit --fix --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 ## for automated fixing 

# To launch the front end
skylos run

# Interactive mode - select items to remove
skylos --interactive /path/to/your/project 

# Comment out items
skylos . --interactive --comment-out

# Dry run - see what would be removed
skylos --interactive --dry-run /path/to/your/project 

# Load the results in json format
skylos --json /path/to/your/project 

# Load the results in table format 
skylos --table /path/to/your/project ## the current skylos versoin does not use table anymore, this is kept for backward compatability and will be deprecated in the next update

# Load the results in tree format 
skylos --table /path/to/your/project 

# With confidence
skylos path/to/your/file --confidence 20 ## or whatever value u wanna set
```

## Skylos Gate

<div align="center">
   <img src="assets/gate.png" alt="Skylos gate" width="500">
</div>

Skylos also has a **Quality Gate**. It prevents bad code, security risks, and spaghetti logic from entering your repository.

### 1. Initialize Configuration
Stop using default settings. Generate a `pyproject.toml` configuration file to define your team's standards.

```bash
skylos init
```

This creates a [tool.skylos] section in your pyproject.toml in which you can adjust the rules:

```
[tool.skylos]
# 1. Global Defaults (Applies to all languages)
complexity = 10
nesting = 3
max_args = 5
max_lines = 50
ignore = [] 
model = "gpt-4.1"

# 2. Language Overrides (Optional)
[tool.skylos.languages.typescript]
complexity = 15
nesting = 4

[tool.skylos.gate]
# Gatekeeper Policy
fail_on_critical = true
max_security = 0
max_quality = 10
strict = false
```

### 2. Run the Gate
Use the `--gate` flag to enforce these rules. If the scan fails, Skylos exits with an error code (blocking CI/CD or git push).

```bash
skylos . --quality --danger --gate
```

You will then be asked a series of questions on whether you will like to push. You can choose to select the files manually or push all at once. 

## VS-Code extension

<h2>Extension</h2>
<div align="center">
   <img src="assets/extension.gif" alt="extension" width="800">
</div>

Skylos has a VS Code extension that runs on save like a linter. Runs automatically on save of Python files. You will see highlights + a popup like "Skylos found N items." For more information, refer to the VSC `README.md` inside the marketplace.

The extension runs on Skylos engine. By default, the quality, danger and secrets engine should be running. If it is not, you can turn it on inside `settings`.

### Install

From VS Code Marketplace: "Skylos" (publisher: oha)

Version: `0.2.0`

## Web Interface

<h2>Front end</h2>
<div align="center">
   <img src="assets/FE_SS.png" alt="frontend" width="800">
</div>

Skylos includes a modern web dashboard for interactive analysis:

```bash
skylos run

# Opens browser at http://localhost:5090
```

## Design

### Summary 

Framework endpoints are often invoked externally (eg, via HTTP, signals), so we use framework aware signals + confidence scores to try avoid false positives while still catching dead codes

Name resolution handles aliases and modules, but when things get ambiguous, we rather miss some dead code than accidentally mark live code as dead lmao

Tests are excluded by default because their call patterns are noisy. You can opt in when you really need to audit it

### Understanding Confidence Levels

Skylos uses a confidence-based system to try to handle Python's dynamic nature and web frameworks.

### How Confidence Works

- **Confidence 100**: 100% unused (default imports, obvious dead functions)
- **Confidence 60**: Default value - conservative detection 
- **Confidence 40**: Framework helpers, functions in web app files
- **Confidence 20**: Framework routes, decorated functions
- **Confidence 0**: Show everything

### Framework Detection

When Skylos detects web framework imports (Flask, Django, FastAPI), it applies different confidence levels:

```bash
# only obvious dead codes
skylos app.py --confidence 60  # THIS IS THE DEFAULT

# include unused helpers in framework files  
skylos app.py --confidence 30

# include potentially unused routes
skylos app.py --confidence 20

# everything.. shows how all potential dead code
skylos app.py --confidence 0
```

## Multi-Language Support

Skylos uses a Router Architecture to support multiple languages. It automatically detects file extensions and routes them to the correct analyzer.

### TypeScript (.ts, .tsx)
Skylos uses tree-sitter for robust TypeScript parsing.

- Dead Code: Finds unused functions, classes, interfaces, and methods.
- Security (--danger): Detects eval(), innerHTML XSS, and React `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Quality (--quality): Calculates Cyclomatic Complexity for TS functions.

**Note**: You do not need to install Node.js. The parser is built into Skylos.

## Test File Detection

Skylos automatically excludes test files from analysis because test code patterns often appear as "dead code" but are actually called by test frameworks. Should you need to include them in your test, just refer to the [Folder Management](#folder-management)  

### What Gets Detected as Test Files

**File paths containing:**
- `/test/` or `/tests/` directories
- Files ending with `_test.py`

**Test imports:**
- `pytest`, `unittest`, `nose`, `mock`, `responses`

**Test decorators:**  
- `@pytest.fixture`, `@pytest.mark.*`
- `@patch`, `@mock.*`

### Test File Behavior

When Skylos detects a test file, it by default, will apply a confidence penalty of 100, which will essentially filter out all dead code detection

```bash
# This will show 0 dead code because its treated as test file
/project/tests/test_user.py
/project/test/helper.py  
/project/utils_test.py

# The files will be analyzed normally. Note that it doesn't end with _test.py
/project/user.py
/project/test_data.py 
```

## Vibe-Coding

We are aware that vibe coding has created a lot of vulnerabilities. To an AI, it's job is to spit out a list of tokens with the highest probability, whether it's right or not. This may introduce vulnerabilities in their applications. We have expanded Skylos to catch the most important problems first. 

- SQL injection (cursor)
- SQL injection (raw-API)
- Command injection
- SSRF
- Path traversal
- eval/exec
- pickle.load/loads
- yaml.load w/o SafeLoader
- weak hashes MD5/SHA1
- subprocess(..., shell=True)
- requests(..., verify=False) 

### Quick Start

```bash
skylos /path/to/your/project --danger
```

### Examples that will be flagged

```
# SQLi (cursor)
cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='{name}'")

# SQLi (raw-api)
pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='" + q + "'", conn)

# Command injection
os.system("zip -r out.zip " + folder)

# SSRF
requests.get(request.args["url"], timeout=3)

# Path traversal
with open(request.args.get("p"), "r") as f: ...
```

This list will be expanded in the near future. For more information, refer to `DANGEROUS_CODE.md` 

## AI Audit

### Audit

Skylos now integrates with LLMs to fix bugs and audit code logic. We only support **OpenAI** and **Anthropic** models for now. We will integrate more models and providers in the upcoming months

```bash
skylos . --audit 
```
**Note**: If you leave this empty, the default is gpt-4.1

If you want to select your own model

```bash
skylos . --audit --quality --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

By default, Skylos will run a few checks namely: 

- Vibe Coding Detection: Checks if code calls functions that do not actually exist in the repo.
- Secret Leaks: Scans comments and variable assignments for hardcoded secrets.
- Logic Flaws: Detects confusing logic or bare exceptions.
- Dangerous Codes

### Fix

```bash
skylos . --fix
```

Supports OpenAI and Anthropic.

Secure: API keys are asked for once and stored in your OS Keychain (Windows Credential Locker, macOS Keychain, etc.).

## Quality

### Code Quality

Static checks that highlight functions likely to be hard to maintain (even if they're not "dead code"). Off by default. You can enable with `--quality`.

### What it checks

Cyclomatic complexity (a.k.a. “McCabe”): counts your decision points (ifs, loops, try/except, comprehensions, boolean ops, etc.).

Nesting depth: how many levels deep your control-flow is. Deeply nested code is harder to read and refactor.

### How to run

`skylos /path/to/your/project --quality`

- Quality Issues
================
1. [Complexity | Warn] app.omg_quality @ /path/app.py:1
   High cyclomatic complexity: 13 (target ≤ 10), 27 lines.
   -> This function has a lot of branching and loops.
   -> Suggested fix: split parts into smaller helpers or simplify nested if/else logic.

2. [Nesting | Medium] app.omg_quality @ /path/app.py:1
   Deep nesting: depth 3 (target ≤ 2), 27 lines.
   -> This function has a lot of branching and loops.
   -> Suggested fix: use guard clauses / flatten branches.

* Complexity 13 (target ≤ 10): the computed cyclomatic complexity is 13; the default target is 10.
* Nesting depth 3 (target ≤ 2): control-flow is 3 levels deep.

### Tuning thresholds (devs) 

**DO NOTE**: 

Right now thresholds are code-level constants (keeps the CLI simple). If you need to tweak:

1. Open `skylos/rules/quality/quality.py`

2. Change these functions:
  * scan_complex_functions(ctx, threshold=10)
  * scan_nesting(ctx, threshold=2)

Config file support is on the roadmap

## Ignoring Pragmas

1. To ignore any warning, indicate `# pragma: no skylos` **ON THE SAME LINE** as the function/class you want to ignore

Example

```python
    def with_logging(self, enabled: bool = True) -> "WebPath":     # pragma: no skylos
        new_path = WebPath(self._url)
        return new_path
```

2. To suppress a **secret** on a line, add: `# skylos: ignore[SKY-S101]`
 
Example
 ```python

API_KEY = "ghp_aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"  # skylos: ignore[SKY-S101]
```

## Coverage Integration

Static analysis can't see everything. Python's dynamic nature means patterns like `getattr()`, plugin registries, and string-based dispatch look like dead code—but they're not.

**Coverage integration solves this.** If a function actually ran during tests or execution, it's definitely not dead.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Step 1: 
# Option 1: Let Skylos run your tests first
skylos . --coverage

# Option 2: Use existing coverage data
coverage run -m pytest    # or: coverage run app.py
skylos .                   # Auto-detects .coverage file

# Step 2:
# Run skylos as per usual
skylos . --danger --quality 
```

### How It Works

| Analysis Type | Confidence | What It Catches |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| Static only | 60-95% | Direct calls, imports, decorators |
| + Coverage | 100% | Dynamic dispatch, plugins, registries |

### Example
```python
# Static analysis thinks this is dead (no direct call visible)
def handle_login():
    return "Login handler"

# But it's called dynamically at runtime
action = request.args.get("action")  
func = getattr(module, f"handle_{action}")
func()  # Calls handle_login
```

| Without Coverage | With Coverage |
|------------------|---------------|
| `handle_login` flagged as dead ❌ | `handle_login` marked as used ✅ |

### When To Use

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Have pytest/unittest tests | `skylos . --coverage` |
| No tests, but can run app | `coverage run app.py` then `skylos .` |
| No tests, can't run app | `skylos .` (static only) |

### What Coverage Catches

These patterns are invisible to static analysis but caught with coverage:
```python
# 1. Dynamic dispatch
func = getattr(module, f"handle_{action}")
func()

# 2. Plugin/registry patterns  
PLUGINS = []
def register(f): PLUGINS.append(f); return f

@register
def my_plugin(): ...  # Called via: for p in PLUGINS: p()

# 3. Subclass discovery
for cls in BasePlugin.__subclasses__():
    cls().run()

# 4. String-based access
globals()["my_" + "func"]()
locals()[func_name]()
```

### Important Notes

- **Coverage only adds information.** Low test coverage will not create false positives. It just means some dynamic patterns may still be flagged.
- **Any execution helps.** Even running your app once and hitting a few endpoints provides useful data.
- **Tests don't need to pass.** Coverage records are what is executed. Irregardless of pass/fail status of your tests

## Including & Excluding Files

### Default Exclusions
By default, Skylos excludes common folders: `__pycache__`, `.git`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.tox`, `htmlcov`, `.coverage`, `build`, `dist`, `*.egg-info`, `venv`, `.venv`

### Folder Options
```bash
skylos --list-default-excludes

# Exclude single folder (The example here will be venv)
skylos /path/to/your/project --exclude-folder venv 

# Exclude multiple folders
skylos /path/to/your/project --exclude-folder venv --exclude-folder build

# Force include normally excluded folders
skylos /path/to/your/project --include-folder venv 

# Scan everything (no exclusions)
skylos path/to/your/project --no-default-excludes 
```

## CLI Options
```
Usage: skylos [OPTIONS] PATH

Arguments:
  PATH  Path to the Python project to analyze

Options:
  -h, --help                   Show this help message and exit
  --json                       Output raw JSON instead of formatted text  
  --table                      Output results in table format via the CLI
  -o, --output FILE            Write output to file instead of stdout
  -v, --verbose                Enable verbose output
  --version                    Checks version
  -i, --interactive            Interactively select items to remove
  --dry-run                    Show what would be removed without modifying files

```

## Interactive Mode

The interactive mode lets you select specific functions and imports to remove:

1. **Select items**: Use arrow keys and `spacebar` to select/unselect
2. **Confirm changes**: Review selected items before applying
3. **Auto-cleanup**: Files are automatically updated

## CI/CD (Pre-commit & GitHub Actions)

Pick **one** (or use **both**) 

1. GitHub Actions: runs Skylos on pushes/PRs in CI.
   - No local install needed

2. Pre-commit (local + CI): runs Skylos before commits/PRs.
   - You must install pre-commit locally once. Skylos gets installed automatically by the hook.

### Option A — Github Actions

1. Create .github/workflows/skylos.yml **(COPY THE ENTIRE SKYLOS.YAML FROM BELOW)**:

```yaml
name: Skylos Deadcode Scan

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      SKYLOS_STRICT: ${{ vars.SKYLOS_STRICT || 'false' }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
          cache: 'pip'

      - name: Install Skylos
        run: pip install skylos

      - name: Run Skylos
        env:
          REPORT: skylos_${{ github.run_number }}_${{ github.sha }}.json
        run: |
          echo "REPORT=$REPORT" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          skylos . --json > "$REPORT"
        id: scan

      - name: Fail if there are findings
        continue-on-error: ${{ env.SKYLOS_STRICT != 'true' }}
        env:
          REPORT: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.REPORT }}
        run: |
            python - << 'PY'
            import json, sys, os
            report = os.environ["REPORT"]
            data = json.load(open(report, "r", encoding="utf-8"))
            count = 0
            for value in data.values():
                if isinstance(value, list):
                    count += len(value)
            print(f"Findings: {count}")
            if count > 0:
              print(f"::warning title=Skylos findings::{count} potential issues found. See {report}")
            sys.exit(1 if count > 0 else 0)
            PY

      - name: Upload report artifact
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.REPORT }}
          path: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.REPORT }}

      - name: Summarize in job log
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "Skylos report: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.REPORT }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

**To make the job fail on findings (strict mode)**:

1. Go to GitHub -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> Variables

2. Add variable SKYLOS_STRICT with value true

### Option B — Pre-commit (local + CI)

. Create or edit `.pre-commit-config.yaml` at the repo root:

**A: Skylos hook repo**
```yaml
## .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos
    rev: v2.7.0
    hooks:
      - id: skylos-scan
        name: skylos report
        entry: python -m skylos.cli
        language: python
        types_or: [python]
        pass_filenames: false
        require_serial: true
        args: [".", "--output", "report.json", "--confidence", "70", "--danger"]

  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: skylos-fail-on-findings
        name: skylos
        env:
          SKYLOS_SOFT: "1"
        language: python
        language_version: python3
        pass_filenames: false
        require_serial: true
        entry: >
          python -c "import os, json, sys, pathlib;
          p=pathlib.Path('report.json');

          if not p.exists(): 
            sys.exit(0);

          data=json.loads(p.read_text(encoding='utf-8'));

          count = 0
          for v in data.values():
            if isinstance(v, list):
              count += len(v)

          print(f'[skylos] findings: {count}');
          sys.exit(0 if os.getenv('SKYLOS_SOFT') or count==0 else 1)"
```
**B: self-contained local hook**

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: skylos-scan

**Install requirements:**

You must install pre-commit locally once:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

2. pre-commit run --all-files

3. Run the same hooks in CI (GitHub Actions): create .github/workflows/pre-commit.yml:

```yaml
name: pre-commit
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with: { python-version: "3.11", cache: "pip" }
      - uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.1
        with: { extra_args: --all-files }
```

**Pre commit behavior:** the second hook is soft by default (SKYLOS_SOFT=1). This means that it prints findings and passes. You can remove the env/logic if you want pre-commit to block commits on finding

## Development

### Prerequisites

- `Python ≥3.9`
- `pytest`
- `inquirer`

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos.git
cd skylos

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

## FAQ 

**Q: Why doesn't Skylos find 100% of dead code?**
A: Python's dynamic features (getattr, globals, etc.) can't be perfectly analyzed statically. No tool can achieve 100% accuracy. If they say they can, they're lying.

**Q: Why are the results different on my codebase?**
A: These benchmarks use specific test cases. Your code patterns (frameworks, legacy code, etc.) will give different results.

**Q: Are these benchmarks realistic?**
A: They test common scenarios but can't cover every edge case. Use them as a guide, not gospel.

**Q: Should I automatically delete everything flagged as unused?**
A: No. Always review results manually, especially for framework code, APIs, and test utilities.

**Q: Why did Ruff underperform?**
A: Like all other tools, Ruff is focused on detecting specific, surface-level issues. Tools like Vulture and Skylos are built SPECIFICALLY for dead code detection. It is NOT a specialized dead code detector. If your goal is dead code, then ruff is the wrong tool. It is a good tool but it's like using a wrench to hammer a nail. Good tool, wrong purpose. 

**Q: Why doesn't Skylos detect my unused Flask routes?**
A: Web framework routes are given low confidence (20) because they might be called by external HTTP requests. Use `--confidence 20` to see them. We acknowledge there are current limitations to this approach so use it sparingly.

**Q: What confidence level should I use?**
A: Start with 60 (default) for safe cleanup. Use 30 for framework applications. Use 20 for more comprehensive auditing.

**Q: What does `--danger` check**?
A: It flags common security problems. Refer to `DANGEROUS_CODE.md` for the full details

**Q: What does `--coverage` do?**
A: It runs `pytest` (or `unittest`) with coverage tracking before analysis. Functions that actually executed are marked as used with 100% confidence, eliminating false positives from dynamic dispatch patterns.

**Q: Do I need 100% test coverage for `--coverage` to be useful?**
A: No. However, we **STRONGLY** encourage you to have tests. Any coverage helps. If you have 30% test coverage, that's 30% of your code verified. The other 70% still uses static analysis. Coverage only removes false positives, it never adds them.

**Q: My tests are failing. Can I still use `--coverage`?**
A: Yes. Coverage tracks execution, not pass/fail. Even failing tests provide coverage data.

## Limitations

- **Dynamic code**: `getattr()`, `globals()`, runtime imports are hard to detect
- **Frameworks**: Django models, Flask, FastAPI routes may appear unused but aren't
- **Test data**: Limited scenarios, your mileage may vary
- **False positives**: Always manually review before deleting code
- **Secrets PoC**: May emit both a provider hit and a generic high-entropy hit for the same token. All tokens are detected only in py files (`.py`, `.pyi`, `.pyw`)
- **Quality limitations**: The current `--quality` flag does not allow you to configure the cyclomatic complexity. 
- **Coverage requires execution**: The `--coverage` flag only helps if you have tests or can run your application. Pure static analysis is still available without it.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**
   ```
   Error: Permission denied when removing function
   ```
   Check file permissions before running in interactive mode.

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```
   Interactive mode requires 'inquirer' package
   ```
   Install with: `pip install skylos[interactive]`
