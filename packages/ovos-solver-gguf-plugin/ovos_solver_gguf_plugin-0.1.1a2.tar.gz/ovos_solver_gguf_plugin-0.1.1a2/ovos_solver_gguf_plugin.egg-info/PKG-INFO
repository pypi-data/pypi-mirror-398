# GGUF Solver

## Overview

`GGUFSolver` is a question-answering module that utilizes GGUF models to provide responses to user queries. This solver
streams utterances for real-time interaction and is built on the `ovos_plugin_manager.templates.solvers.QuestionSolver`
framework.

## Features

- Supports loading GGUF models from local files or remote repositories.
- Streams partial responses for improved interactivity.
- Configurable persona and verbosity settings.
- Capable of providing spoken answers.

## Configuration

`GGUFSolver` requires a configuration dictionary. The configuration should at least specify the model to use. Here is an
example configuration:

```python
cfg = {
    "model": "TheBloke/notus-7B-v1-GGUF",
    "remote_filename": "*Q4_K_M.gguf"
}
```

- `model`: The identifier for the model. It can be a local file path or a repository ID for a remote model.
- `n_gpu_layers`: how many layer to offload to GPU, `-1` to offload all. default `0`
- `remote_filename`: The specific filename to load from a remote repository.
- `chat_format`: (Optional) Chat formatting settings.
- `verbose`: (Optional) Set to `True` for detailed logging.
- `persona`: (Optional) Persona for the system messages. Default
  is `"You are a helpful assistant who gives short factual answers"`.
- `max_tokens`: (Optional) Maximum tokens for the response. Default is `512`.

**NOTE**: for GPU support llama.cpp needs to be compiled with

`CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_CUDA=on" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install llama-cpp-python --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir`

## Usage

### Initializing the Solver

```python
from ovos_gguf_solver import GGUFSolver
from ovos_utils.log import LOG

LOG.set_level("DEBUG")

cfg = {
    "model": "TheBloke/notus-7B-v1-GGUF",
    "remote_filename": "*Q4_K_M.gguf"
}

solver = GGUFSolver(cfg)
```

### Streaming Utterances

Use the `stream_utterances` method to stream responses. This is particularly useful for real-time applications such as
voice assistants.

```python
query = "tell me a joke about aliens"
for sentence in solver.stream_utterances(query):
    print(sentence)
```

### Getting a Full Answer

Use the `get_spoken_answer` method to get a complete response.

```python
query = "What is the capital of France?"
answer = solver.get_spoken_answer(query)
print(answer)
```

## Integrating with Persona Framework

To integrate `GGUFSolver` with the OVOS Persona Framework and pass solver configurations, follow these examples.

Each example demonstrates how to define a persona configuration file with specific settings for different models or configurations.

To use any of these configurations, run the OVOS Persona Server with the desired configuration file:

```bash
$ ovos-persona-server --persona gguf_persona_remote.json
```

Replace `gguf_persona_remote.json` with the filename of the configuration you wish to use.

### Example 1: Using a Remote GGUF Model

This example shows how to configure the `GGUFSolver` to use a remote GGUF model with a specific persona.

**`gguf_persona_remote.json`**:

```json
{
  "name": "Notus",
  "solvers": [
    "ovos-solver-gguf-plugin"
  ],
  "ovos-solver-gguf-plugin": {
    "model": "TheBloke/notus-7B-v1-GGUF",
    "remote_filename": "*Q4_K_M.gguf",
    "persona": "You are an advanced assistant providing detailed and accurate information.",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

In this configuration:
- `ovos-solver-gguf-plugin` is set to use a remote GGUF model `TheBloke/notus-7B-v1-GGUF` with the specified filename.
- The persona is configured to provide detailed and accurate information.
- `verbose` is set to `true` for detailed logging.

### Example 2: Using a Local GGUF Model

This example shows how to configure the `GGUFSolver` to use a local GGUF model.

**`gguf_persona_local.json`**:

```json
{
  "name": "LocalGGUFPersona",
  "solvers": [
    "ovos-solver-gguf-plugin"
  ],
  "ovos-solver-gguf-plugin": {
    "model": "/path/to/local/model/gguf_model.gguf",
    "persona": "You are a helpful assistant providing concise answers.",
    "max_tokens": 256
  }
}
```

In this configuration:
- `ovos-solver-gguf-plugin` is set to use a local GGUF model located at `/path/to/local/model/gguf_model.gguf`.
- The persona is configured to provide concise answers.
- `max_tokens` is set to `256` to limit the response length.
