              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

`mlinfra` is the swiss army knife for deploying MLOps tooling anywhere. It aims to make MLOps infrastructure deployment easy and accessible to all ML teams by liberating IaC logic for creating MLOps stacks which is usually tied to other frameworks.

Contribute to the project by opening a issue or joining project roadmap and design related discussion on [discord](https://discord.gg/8eYWVvEYmR). Complete roadmap will be released soon!

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements
`mlinfra` requires the following to run perfectly:

- `terraform` >= `1.10.2` should be installed on the system.

`mlinfra` can be installed simply by creating a python virtual environment and installing `mlinfra` pip package
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install mlinfra
```

Copy a deployment config from the [examples](https://github.com/mlinfra-io/mlinfra/tree/4d21aa465fa8d40aabcf9877f3f99c4ede687459/examples) folder, change your AWS account in the config file, configure your AWS credentials and deploy the configuration using

```bash
mlinfra terraform apply --config-file <path-to-your-config>
```

For more information, read the [mlinfra user guide](https://mlinfra.io/user_guide/)

## Deployment Config

`mlinfra` deploys infrastructure using declarative approach. It requires resources to be defined in a `yaml` file with the following format

```yaml
name: aws-mlops-stack
provider:
  name: aws
  account-id: xxxxxxxxx
  region: eu-central-1
deployment:
  type: cloud_vm # (this would create ec2 instances and then deploy applications on it)
stack:
  data_versioning:
    - lakefs # can also be pachyderm or lakefs or neptune and so on
  experiment_tracker:
    - mlflow # can be weights and biases or determined, or neptune or clearml and so on...
  orchestrator:
    - zenml # can also be argo, or luigi, or airflow, or dagster, or prefect or flyte or kubeflow or ray and so on...
  model_inference:
    - bentoml # can also be ray or KF serving or seldoncore or tf serving
  monitoring:
    - nannyML # can be grafana or alibi or evidently or neptune or prometheus or weaveworks and so on...
  alerting:
    - mlflow # can be mlflow or neptune or determined or weaveworks or prometheus or grafana and so on...
```

- For examples, check out the [documentation](https://mlinfra.io/latest/code/local/kind/).

- _*NOTE*_: This was minimal spec for aws cloud as infra with custom applications. Other stacks such as feature_store, event streamers, loggers or [cost dashboards](https://www.kubecost.com/) can be added via community requests. For more information, please [check out the docs](https://mlinfra.io/).

## Supported Providers

The core purpose is to build for all cloud and deployment platforms out there. Any user should be able to just change the cloud provider or runtime environment (whether it be linux or windows) and have the capability to deploy the same tools.

mlinfra will be supporting the following providers:

#### Local machine (for development)
  - [x] [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
  - [x] [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/)
  - [ ] [k3s](https://k3s.io/)
  - [ ] [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  - [ ] [k0s](https://k0sproject.io/) (for a more hybrid approach)

#### Cloud Providers (for deployment and production ready)
- [x] [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [ ] [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [ ] [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us)
- [ ] [AliBaba](https://www.alibabacloud.com/)
- [ ] [Openstack](https://www.openstack.org/)
- [ ] [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/)
- [ ] Bare metal (such as [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/de) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/))

## Supported deployment types

When deploying on managed cloud providers, users can deploy their infrastructure on top of either:
- `Virtual Machines` such as [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) on AWS Cloud, [Google Virtual machine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances) instances on GCP Cloud and [Azure Virtual Machine](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/virtual-machines) on Azure Cloud.
- or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) such as [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) on AWS Cloud, [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) on GCP Cloud and [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service) on Azure Cloud.


## Supported MLOps Tools

`mlinfra` intends to support as many [MLOps tools](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning/) deployable in a platform in their standalone as well as high availability across different layers of an MLOps stack:
- `data_ingestion`
- `data_versioning`
- `data_processing`
- `vector_database`
- `experiment_tracker`
- `orchestrator`
- `model_inference`
- `monitoring`
- `alerting`

## Development

- This project relies on terraform for IaC code and python to glue it all together.
- To get started, install terraform and python.
- You can install the required python packages by running `uv sync`
- You can run any of the available examples from the `examples/` folder by running the following command in root directory `python src/mlinfra/cli/cli.py terraform <action> --config-file examples/<deployment-type>/<file>.yaml` where `<action>` corresponds to terraform actions such as `plan`, `apply` and `destroy`.

For more information, please refer to the Engineering Wiki of the project (https://mlinfra.io/user_guide/) regarding what are the different components of the project and how they work together.

## Contributions

- Contributions are welcome! Help us onboard all of the available mlops tools on currently available cloud providers.
- For major changes, please open [an issue](https://github.com/mlinfra-io/mlinfra/issues) first to discuss what you would like to change. A team member will get to you soon.
- For information on the general development workflow, see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
