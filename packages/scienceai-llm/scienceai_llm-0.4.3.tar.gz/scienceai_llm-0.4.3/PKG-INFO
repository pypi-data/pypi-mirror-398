**An AI-Powered Research Assistant for Systematic Literature Analysis**

ScienceAI is a Python application that transforms how researchers analyze scientific literature. Unlike a standard LLM chatbot, ScienceAI is specifically designed to handle complex, multi-paper research tasks through an intelligent agent-based architecture that supports both GPT-5.2, Claude, and Gemini models.

---

## 🎯 Why ScienceAI vs. a Regular LLM Chatbot?

| Standard LLM Chatbot | ScienceAI |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Single conversation context | **Multi-agent system** with specialized analyst agents |
| Manual upload of each document excerpt | **Automatic processing** of hundreds of PDFs |
| Limited by context window (~200K tokens) | **Processes entire paper collections** regardless of size |
| Requires you to extract data manually | **Automated data extraction** with structured schemas |
| One-off responses | **Persistent analysis** with downloadable results |
| No systematic validation | **Built-in validation** and provenance tracking |
| Generic responses | **Evidence-based answers** with source citations |

### The Key Difference: Agentic Architecture

ScienceAI employs a **Principal Investigator (PI)** that:
- Breaks down your research question into manageable sub-tasks
- Creates specialized **Analyst Agents** for each sub-task
- Coordinates parallel data extraction across your entire paper collection
- Synthesizes findings from multiple analysts
- Provides comprehensive, evidence-backed answers

This means you can ask: *"Extract healing times, sample sizes, and intervention types from all these papers"* and ScienceAI will automatically create the right analysts, define extraction schemas, process all papers, and return structured CSV data—something impossible with a standard chatbot.

---

## 🚀 Main Features

- **📚 Automated Paper Processing**: Upload PDFs and let ScienceAI extract text, figures, tables, and metadata automatically
- **🤖 AI-Driven Multi-Agent Analysis**: The PI delegates tasks to specialized Analyst Agents that work autonomously
- **📊 Structured Data Extraction**: Define data schemas and extract information systematically across all papers
- **💬 Interactive Research Discussion**: Ask complex research questions and receive evidence-backed answers
- **🔍 Provenance Tracking**: Every extracted data point includes source quotes and derivation explanations
- **📈 Export & Visualization**: Download extracted data as CSV, export papers with metadata, view analysis results in an interactive interface
- **🌙 Dark Mode**: Fully supported dark mode for comfortably working in low-light environments, including specialized styling for data viewers.
- **💾 Project Management**: Save and resume research projects with full checkpoint support

Upload 100+ papers, ask the PI to categorize them by intervention type, extract study characteristics, and generate summary tables—all automatically.

### 2. **Meta-Analysis Data Extraction**
Request extraction of effect sizes, sample sizes, and study parameters. ScienceAI handles the schema definition, extraction, validation, and CSV export.

### 3. **Research Gap Analysis**
Ask "What methodologies are under-represented?" and let analysts scan all papers to identify patterns and gaps.

### 4. **Evidence Synthesis**
"Summarize all findings related to [X]" triggers analysts to extract relevant sections, synthesize findings, and provide citations.

---

## 🐍 Python Library Usage

ScienceAI can also be used as a Python library to integrate its capabilities into your own scripts and applications.

### Initialization

```python
from scienceai.client import ScienceAI

# Initialize the client (starts backend automatically)
client = ScienceAI(project_name="MyResearchProject")
```

### Ingesting Papers
You can upload papers programmatically and trigger preprocessing.

```python
# Upload papers and wait for preprocessing to complete
client.upload_papers(["/path/to/paper1.pdf", "/path/to/paper2.pdf"])

# Or upload without immediate preprocessing
client.upload_papers(["/path/to/paper3.pdf"], trigger_preprocess=False)

# Manually trigger preprocessing later
client.preprocess()
```

### Chatting with the PI

Interact with the Principal Investigator to ask questions or request analyses.

```python
# Send a message and wait for the response (blocking)
response = client.chat("Summarize the findings of the uploaded papers.")
print(response)

# Non-blocking chat
client.chat_background("Extract sample sizes from all papers.")

# Poll for status
while True:
    result = client.poll()
    if result:
        print("Response received:", result)
        break
    print("Working...")
    time.sleep(1)

# Get full history
history = client.history()
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### LLM Provider Selection

ScienceAI supports multiple LLM providers with flexible authentication options:

#### Supported Providers
- **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-5, o4-mini): Default provider
- **Anthropic** (Claude Sonnet/Opus 4.5): Via direct API or Google Vertex AI
- **Google** (Gemini 3 Pro): Via API key or Vertex AI service account

#### Setting Up Providers

**OpenAI (Required for  Default Setup)**
```bash
# Method 1: Interactive setup
scienceai --setup-keys

# Method 2: Direct key setting
scienceai --set-key openai YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

# Method 3: Environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

**Anthropic Claude (Optional)**
```bash
# Direct API (recommended for personal use)
scienceai --set-key anthropic YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Or via environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

**Google Gemini (Optional)**
```bash
# Standard API key (simple setup)
scienceai --set-key google YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY

# Or via environment variable
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
# or
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
```

#### GCP Service Account for Production/Enterprise

For production deployments or enterprise use, you can use a GCP service account for both Gemini and Claude on Vertex AI:

**Setup:**
```bash
scienceai --gcp-service-account /path/to/service-account.json
```

This will:
1. Validate your service account file
2. Extract the project ID automatically
3. **Prompt you interactively**:
   ```
   ✓ Valid service account file for project: my-project-123
     This service account can be used for:
       1. Google Gemini (native GCP models)
       2. Claude on Vertex AI (Anthropic partner models)

   Use this service account for Claude on Vertex AI? (y/n):
   ```
4. Ask for your preferred Vertex AI region:
   ```
   Common Vertex AI regions:
     - us-east5 (US East)
     - us-central1 (US Central)
     - europe-west1 (Europe West)
   Enter Vertex AI region (default: us-east5):
   ```
5. Save the configuration

**Remove GCP Configuration:**
```bash
scienceai --remove-gcp-config
```

This command allows you to selectively remove Gemini and/or Claude Vertex configurations, reverting to API key authentication.

**Priority Order:**
- If both GCP service account AND API key are configured for a provider:
  1. **GCP Service Account** takes priority (recommended for production)
  2. **API Key** is used as fallback

This design allows smooth transitions between development (API key) and production (service account) environments.

### Provider Switching

Switch between providers via the **LLM Provider** card in the menu UI. Select:
- **OpenAI** (GPT models)
- **Claude** (Anthropic direct API)
- **Claude on Vertex** (via GCP - if configured)
- **Gemini** (Google models)

Unavailable providers (missing API keys) are grayed out.

### Validate Your Configuration

Test all configured API keys:
```bash
scienceai --validate-keys
```

Output:
```
Validating configured API keys...

  ✓ openai: Valid (gpt-5.2 accessible)
  ✓ anthropic: Valid (claude-sonnet-4-5 accessible)
  ✗ google: Invalid (API key expired)

⚠ Some keys failed validation
```

### CLI Options Reference

```bash
# API Key Management
scienceai --setup-keys                    # Interactive key setup
scienceai --set-key PROVIDER KEY         # Set a specific key

## 📚 Detailed Documentation

### 🧠 Principal Investigator (PI)
The **Principal Investigator** (`src/scienceai/principal_investigator.py`) is the central orchestrator of the system. It uses an LLM-driven reasoning loop to:

1.  **Plan Research**: Decomposes user queries into sub-tasks.
2.  **Delegate**: Spawns **Analyst Agents** using `delegate_research()` to handle specific data extraction or analysis tasks.
3.  **Execute Code**: Uses `run_python_code()` to perform statistical analysis, generate plots, or manipulate data using Python (pandas, matplotlib, etc.).
4.  **Synthesize**: Aggregates results from multiple analysts using `reflect_on_delegations()` to provide a cohesive answer.
5.  **Transparency**: All PI actions are recorded and visible via the "Show work..." feature in the UI, exposing tool calls, arguments, and internal reasoning.

### 🕵️ Analyst Agents
**Analyst Agents** (`src/scienceai/analyst.py`) are specialized, autonomous workers created by the PI. Each analyst has a specific `goal` (e.g., "Extract patient demographics") and follows this workflow:

1.  **Paper Selection**: Identifies relevant papers using `get_all_papers()` or filters by criteria.
2.  **Schema Generation**: Automatically generates a JSON schema for data extraction based on its goal.
3.  **Concurrent Extraction**: Runs `extract_data()` across all selected papers in parallel.
4.  **Validation**: Uses `reflect_on_evidence()` to verify that extracted data is supported by the source text.
5.  **Data Collection**: Saves structured results into a named collection (e.g., `DemographicsData`) which becomes available to the PI and the user.

### ⛏️ Data Extraction Engine
The **Data Extraction Engine** (`src/scienceai/data_extractor.py`) is the core NLP component responsible for turning unstructured PDF text into structured data.

-   **Supported Types**: `number`, `date`, `text_block`, `categorical`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`.
-   **Provenance Injection**: Automatically adds metadata to every extracted field:
    -   `_source_quote`: The verbatim text from the paper supporting the data.
    -   `_source_location`: Page number and context.
    -   `_derivation`: Logic used to calculate values (e.g., "Calculated as 15 males + 12 females").
-   **Reflection & Validation**: The `reflect_on_data_extraction()` function acts as a critic, comparing the extracted JSON against the paper's text to catch hallucinations or errors before saving.

### 💾 Database & Storage
Managed by `DatabaseManager` (`src/scienceai/database_manager.py`), the system uses a file-based storage approach for portability and simplicity.

-   **Paper Ingestion**: PDFs are hashed (`sha256`) to prevent duplicates. Text, tables, and figures are extracted and stored.
-   **Storage Format**: Uses `dictdatabase` to store project state, chat history, and data collections as JSON files.
-   **Checkpoints**: The system supports full project checkpointing. The `save_database()` function creates a zip archive of the project directory, allowing users to backup, share, or resume their work at any time.
-   **Export**: Data can be exported as CSVs, and papers can be renamed/exported based on their metadata.
