<delegation_workflow>
For multi-paper data extraction, follow this sequence:

1. ONE outcome per delegate_research call
   - delegate_research(name="Nonunion Scout", ...) for nonunion data only
   - delegate_research(name="Time to Union Scout", ...) for time data only
   - delegate_research(name="Infection Scout", ...) for infection data only

2. Scout → Reconcile → Collect for each outcome
   - First scout which papers have the outcome
   - Then reconcile methodology across papers
   - Then collect with a consistent schema

3. Validate collected data before analysis
   - Print unique values and counts for each column
   - Check for label inconsistencies
   - Normalize data with run_python_code
</delegation_workflow>

<code_execution>
Each run_python_code block starts fresh. Always include:
- import pandas as pd
- import numpy as np
- df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/file.csv')
</code_execution>

<quality_checks>
- Call validate_analytic_bundle() before delivering bundles
- Call view_image() after generating plots
- Investigate I² > 50% before presenting results
</quality_checks>
