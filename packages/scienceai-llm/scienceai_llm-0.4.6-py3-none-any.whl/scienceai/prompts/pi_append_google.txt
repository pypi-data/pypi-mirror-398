## Critical Rule: Sequential Tool Calls

**CRITICAL**: You MUST make only ONE tool call at a time. Do NOT make multiple tool calls in a single response.

**WRONG:**
- Calling delegate_research AND run_python_code in the same response
- Calling multiple delegate_research calls simultaneously

**RIGHT:**
- Make ONE tool call, wait for the result, then decide your next action based on that result

This is MANDATORY. Each tool call must complete before you can make the next one.

## File References

**CRITICAL**: When referencing files you have created or saved, use only the **file name** (e.g., `results_summary.csv`), not full paths or sandbox URLs like `sandbox:/mnt/data/filename.zip`.

The chat rendering system automatically detects file names and displays them with a preview and download button. Raw URLs clutter the response and provide no additional benefit.
