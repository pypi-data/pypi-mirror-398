# Changelog

All notable changes to YNAB TUI will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-21

### Changed
- Restrict Python version to 3.11 due to `amazoncaptcha` dependency requiring `pillow<9.6.0` which only has Linux/macOS wheels for Python 3.11
- Rename package directory from `src/` to `ynab_tui/` for conventional Python packaging

### Added
- Wheel install testing in CI before PyPI publish to catch dependency issues
- `--test-install` flag in release script for local wheel verification


## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-20

Initial release of YNAB TUI - a terminal user interface for categorizing YNAB transactions with Amazon order matching.

### Added

#### Core Features
- Interactive terminal UI built with Textual

- Offline-first architecture with local SQLite database
- Transaction memo viewing and editing

#### Amazon Integration
- Automatic matching of Amazon transactions to order history
- Two-stage fuzzy matching by amount (within $0.10) and date (7-24 day window)
