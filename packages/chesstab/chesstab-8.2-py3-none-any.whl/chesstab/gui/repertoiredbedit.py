    showinitial determines whether a RepertoireToplevel is created for

    Attribute pgn_score_name provides the name used in widget titles and

    Attribute pgn_score_tags provides empty PGN tags to present when creating
    an insert Toplevel.  It is the empty PGN tags defined for repertoires in
    ChessTab..

    Attribute pgn_score_source provides the error key value to index a PGN
    game score with errors.

    Methods _get_title_for_object and _set_item, and properties ui_base_table;
    ui_items_in_toplevels; and ui, allow similar methods in various classes
