"""Widget to display a game of chess.

The display contains the game score, a board with the current position in the
game, and any analysis of the current position by chess engines.

The Game class displays a game of chess.

Instances of Game have an instance of score.Score as an attribute to display
chess engine analysis as well as inheriting much of their function from the
Score class.

An instance of Game fits into the user interface in two ways: as an item in a
panedwindow of the main widget, or as the only item in a new toplevel widget.

"""
# Obsolete comment, but the idea is being realised through the displaypgn and
# displaytext modules.  (partial has meanwhile become cql).
# Game (game.py) and Partial (partial.py) should be
# subclasses of some more basic class.  They are not because Game started
# as a game displayer while Partial started as a Text widget with no
# validation and they have been converging ever since.  Next step will get
# there.  Obviously this applies to subclasses GameEdit (gameedit.py)
# and PartialEdit (partialedit.py) as well.

# Score is now a superclass of Game.  It is a PGN handling class, not the
# 'more basic class' above.
