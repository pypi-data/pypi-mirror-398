## Requirements

`wg-Qrotator` is compatible with both Linux. It requires Python version 3.10 or higher, and PIP. In a Linux machine most dependencies can be installed by running the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip libexplain-dev build-essential automake autoconf libtool pkg-config git
```
