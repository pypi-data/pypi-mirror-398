1. **Clarity & Readability (20 points)** - Is the documentation written in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand manner?
2. **Completeness (20 points)** - Does the documentation cover all essential information needed for understanding, usage, and further development?
3. **Organization & Navigation (10 points)** - Is the structure logical and easy to navigate? Are key sections easy to find?
4. **Examples & Tutorials (10 points)** - Are there sufficient examples or tutorials to help users get started and understand core functionality?
5. **Maintainability & Updates (15 points)** - Does the documentation reflect ongoing maintenance and version history (e.g., changelogs, version tags)?
6. **Accessibility & Formatting (15 points)** - Is the documentation well-formatted and easy to read (e.g., Markdown formatting, appropriate use of code blocks, headers, etc.)?
