         Statement of Purpose
         
         The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
         exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
         and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
         authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
         
         Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
         the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
         scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
         of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
         works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
         and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
         These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
         culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
         works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
         part through the use and efforts of others.
         
         For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
         expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
         associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
         is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
         elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
         terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
         Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
         
         1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
         protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
         Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
         limited to, the following:
         
           i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
              communicate, and translate a Work;
          ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
         iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
              likeness depicted in a Work;
          iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
              subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
           v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
              in a Work;
          vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
              European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
              protection of databases, and under any national implementation
              thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
              directive); and
         vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
              world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
              implementations thereof.
         
         2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
         of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
         irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
         Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
         of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
         future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
         worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
         treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
         medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
         including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
         purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
         member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
         successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
         revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
         equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
         as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
         
         3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
         be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
         Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
         account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
         extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
         person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
         irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
         Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
         maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
         time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
         of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
         limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
         "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
         applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
         reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
         partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
         of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
         will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
         Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
         action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
         express Statement of Purpose.
         
         4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
         
          a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
             surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
          b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
             warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
             statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
             title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
             infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
             the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
             the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
          c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
             that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
             limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
             Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
             consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
             Work.
          d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
             party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
             this CC0 or use of the Work.

# allisbns

![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/allisbns)
[![Tests](https://github.com/xymaxim/allisbns/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/xymaxim/allisbns/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

allisbns is a Python package to work with the packed ISBN codes from [Anna's
Archive](https://annas-archive.org/). It helps you to examine, manipulate, and
plot such data that represent the largest fully open list of all known ISBNs.

*(This project is not affiliated with Anna's Archive.)*

## Introduction

Anna's Archive, besides books and datasets, provides a large amount of metadata
from different sources (including
[WorldCat](https://annas-archive.org/blog/worldcat-scrape.html), Google Books,
the [Chinese
collections](https://annas-archive.org/blog/finished-chinese-release.html), and
many others). Such an extensive collection presumably
[represents](https://annas-archive.org/blog/all-isbns.html) the largest openly
available metadata about all known ISBNs ever published (see the figure below).

The derived metadata, periodically published by Anna and the team, includes the
packed ISBN codes, a very [compact
representation](https://annas-archive.org/blog/all-isbns.html#:~:text=a%20compact%20data%20format)
of all ISBNs with distinction of original data sources: it can tell you what
ISBNs are available in a dataset.

After the [visualization
contest](https://annas-archive.org/blog/all-isbns-winners.html), the beautiful
interactive [viewer](https://annas-archive.org/isbn-visualization) exists to
explore all ISBNs. However, sometimes you need more imperative control over the
available data: check many ISBNs at once, analyze selected regions, compare
different dumps, plot custom images, etc.

*how it is plotted*.

## Installation

The package is available on PyPI:

    pip install allisbns

To include optional plotting support, install it as:

    pip install allisbns[plotting]

## Quickstart

### Download data

The package works with datasets provided as bencoded files named as
`aa_isbn13_codes_*.benc.zst`. Such files are located in the `codes_benc`
directory within the
[aa_derived_mirror_metadata](https://annas-archive.org/torrents/aa_derived_mirror_metadata)
torrents. One file contains ISBN codes for all datasets (collections). See
[here](https://allisbns.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#codes) for more
info about codes.

### Work with datasets

Create a dataset from the downloaded file with ISBN codes:

```python
    >>> from allisbns.dataset import CodeDataset
    >>> md5 = CodeDataset.from_file(
    ...     source="aa_isbn13_codes_20251118T170842Z.benc.zst",
    ...     collection="md5",
    ... )
    >>> md5
    CodeDataset(array([    6,     1,     9, ...,     1, 91739,     1],
      shape=(14737375,), dtype=int32), bounds=(978000000000, 979999468900))
```

The `md5` collection represents files available in Anna's Archive. All available
collections are:

    'airitibooks', 'bloomsbury', 'cadal_ssno', 'cerlalc', 'chinese_architecture',
    'duxiu_ssid', 'edsebk', 'gbooks', 'goodreads', 'hathi', 'huawen_library', 'ia',
    'isbndb', 'isbngrp', 'kulturpass', 'libby', 'md5', 'nexusstc',
    'nexusstc_download', 'oclc', 'ol', 'ptpress', 'rgb', 'sciencereading', 'shukui',
    'sklib', 'trantor', 'wanfang', 'zjjd'

Query one ISBN:

```python
    >>> md5.query_isbn(978_2_36590_117)
    QueryResult(is_streak=True, segment_index=8652142, position_in_segment=0)
```

Check many ISBNs:

```python
    >>> md5.check_isbns(range(978_2_36590_000, 978_2_36590_999 + 1))
    array([ True, False, False, ..., False, False, False], shape=(1000,))
```

Get all filled ISBNs:

```python
    >>> md5.get_filled_isbns()
    array([978000000000, 978000000001, 978000000002, ..., 979999377030,
       979999377160, 979999468900], shape=(16916212,))
```

Crop the dataset to some ISBN region:

```python
    >>> from allisbns.isbn import get_prefix_bounds
    >>> start_isbn, end_isbn = get_prefix_bounds("978")
    >>> md5.reframe(start_isbn, end_isbn)
    CodeDataset(array([6, 1, 9, ..., 1, 2, 2],
       shape=(14503001,), dtype=int32), bounds=(978000000000, 978999999999))
```
