    """Generate collapse (jump) matrices for spontaneous emission from excited states.

    Creates Lindblad collapse operators C that describe spontaneous decay from excited
    states to ground states via electric dipole transitions. Each operator has the form:
        C[i,j] = √(BR * γ)
    where BR is the branching ratio and γ is the decay rate. Couplings smaller than
    tol are set to zero for computational efficiency.

    Args:
        QN (Sequence[CoupledState]): Complete basis of states for the calculation
        ground_states (Sequence[CoupledState]): Ground states coupled to excited states
        excited_states (Sequence[CoupledState]): Excited states that can decay
        gamma (float): Decay rate of excited states in rad/s. Defaults to 1.
        tol (float): Threshold for keeping couplings. Couplings with √(BR) < tol are
            set to zero. Defaults to 1e-4.
        qn_compact (QuantumSelector | Sequence[QuantumSelector] | None): Quantum number
            selectors for compacting multiple states into single manifolds. Defaults to
            None.

    Returns:
        npt.NDArray[np.floating]: Array of collapse matrices, shape (n_ops, n_states,
            n_states), where n_ops is the number of non-zero transitions

        UserWarning: If branching ratios sum to more than 1 (numerical error)
