"""Nuclear spin-rotation Hamiltonian operators for B state in coupled Omega basis.

This module implements the nuclear spin-rotation (NSR) interaction for the thallium
nucleus in the B electronic state. The NSR interaction couples nuclear spin angular
momentum to molecular rotational angular momentum.

The nuclear spin-rotation effect arises from the magnetic field generated by the
rotating charged nuclei acting on the nuclear magnetic moment.

    """Nuclear spin-rotation operator for Tl nucleus in B state (coupled Omega basis).

    Calculates the nuclear spin-rotation (NSR) interaction for the thallium nucleus,
    represented by the scalar coupling constant c(Tl). This diagonal operator couples
    the Tl nuclear spin I₁ to the molecular rotational angular momentum J.

    The operator is diagonal in all quantum numbers (J, I₁, I₂, F₁, F, mF, Ω), making
    it a first-order energy correction to the hyperfine structure. The matrix element
    is proportional to I₁·J.

    Args:
        psi: Input coupled basis state |J,F₁,F,mF,I₁,I₂,Ω⟩ in B electronic state.
        constants: Molecular constants for TlF B state, requires c_Tl parameter
            (Tl nuclear spin-rotation constant).

    Returns:
        CoupledState with a single term containing the NSR energy shift and the
        same basis state as input. The amplitude includes a Wigner 6-j symbol
        for angular momentum recoupling and appropriate normalization factors.

    Notes:
        - The operator is completely diagonal (no state mixing)
        - Selection rules: ΔJ = 0; ΔI₁ = 0; ΔF₁ = 0; ΔF = 0; ΔmF = 0; ΔΩ = 0
        - For TlF B state: c(Tl) ≈ -7.83 MHz
        - The negative sign indicates antiparallel coupling is favored
        - NSR constants are typically much smaller than hyperfine constants
        - The interaction scales with J(J+1) and I₁(I₁+1)
