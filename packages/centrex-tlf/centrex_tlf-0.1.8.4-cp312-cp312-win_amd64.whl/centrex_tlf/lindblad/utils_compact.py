"""Utilities for compacting symbolic Hamiltonians by combining degenerate states.

This module provides functions to reduce the dimensionality of symbolic Hamiltonians
by identifying and combining quantum states that are not coupled to the system of
interest. This compacting reduces computational cost while maintaining physical accuracy.

    """Compact a symbolic Hamiltonian by combining multiple indices into a single state.

    This function reduces the dimensionality of a Hamiltonian matrix by merging
    multiple quantum states (specified by indices) into a single representative state.
    The states to be compacted must satisfy two conditions:
    1. Their diagonal elements must be numeric (no symbolic variables)
    2. They must not have couplings to other states (off-diagonal elements must be zero)

    The compacting process:
    1. Validates that diagonal elements of states to compact are numeric
    2. Validates that these states have no couplings (off-diagonal elements are zero)
    3. Deletes all rows/columns except the first one (the representative state)
    4. Sets the representative state's diagonal element to the mean energy of all
       compacted states

    Args:
        hamiltonian_matrix: The symbolic Hamiltonian matrix to compact. Must be a
            square sympy Matrix with both symbolic and numeric elements.
        indices_compact: Array of matrix indices to compact into a single state.
            Must contain at least one index. The first index becomes the representative
            state that remains in the compacted Hamiltonian.

    Returns:
        A new compacted Hamiltonian matrix with reduced dimensionality. The returned
        matrix has `len(indices_compact) - 1` fewer rows/columns than the input.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If diagonal elements of states to compact contain symbolic
            variables (have free symbols), indicating these states cannot be safely
            compacted.
        AssertionError: If any of the states to compact have non-zero off-diagonal
            elements (couplings), indicating they are coupled to the system and
            cannot be removed.

    Example:
        >>> import sympy as smp
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> # Create a 5x5 Hamiltonian with states 3 and 4 being uncoupled
        >>> H = smp.Matrix([[1, 0.1, 0, 0, 0],
        ...                 [0.1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
        ...                 [0, 0, 100, 0, 0],
        ...                 [0, 0, 0, 200, 0],
        ...                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 300]])
        >>> indices = np.array([2, 3, 4])  # Compact states 2, 3, 4
        >>> H_compact = compact_symbolic_hamiltonian_indices(H, indices)
        >>> H_compact.shape
        (3, 3)
        >>> H_compact[2, 2]  # Mean of 100, 200, 300
        200.0

    Note:
        This function is typically used to remove high-J rotational states that are
        far detuned from the transitions of interest and have no population transfer.
        The mean energy is used for the representative state, though this value is
        largely irrelevant since these states only contribute decay terms.

    """Generate quantum selectors for ground states that can be compacted.

    This function identifies ground electronic state (X) rotational levels that are
    not involved in any of the specified transitions. These states can be safely
    compacted (merged) in the Hamiltonian since they don't participate in the
    dynamics of interest.

    The function works by:
    1. Extracting all J quantum numbers involved in transitions (ground states)
    2. Finding all J values present in the X-state basis
    3. Identifying J values not involved in transitions (candidates for compacting)

            levels in the system.

        levels (specified by J quantum number) that are not involved in any

    Note:
        This function only identifies ground (X) state levels for compacting.
        Excited states (B) are typically always involved in transitions and are
        not considered for compacting. The returned selectors can be passed to
        `compact_symbolic_hamiltonian_indices` to actually perform the compacting.
