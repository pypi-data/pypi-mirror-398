Open-source Python library for building energy analytics, serving as the analytical engine underlying the Building Efficiency Targeting Tool for Energy Retrofits ([BETTER](https://better.lbl.gov/)) web application. BETTER is a software toolkit that enables building operators to quickly, easily identify the most cost-saving energy efficiency measures in buildings and portfolios. BETTER is made possible by support from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Building Technologies Office (BTO).

## Features

- **Change-point Model Fitting**: Automated fitting of 1-, 3-, 5-parameter (1P/3P/5P) change-point models for building energy analysis
- **Building Benchmarking**: Statistical comparison of building energy performance against peer groups
- **Energy Savings Estimation**: Weather-normalized energy savings calculations with uncertainty quantification
- **Energy Efficiency Measure Recommendations**: Rule-based recommendations for energy efficiency improvements
- **Portfolio Analytics**: Aggregate analysis across multiple buildings

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install better-lbnl-os
```

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
uv add better-lbnl-os
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/better-lbnl-os.git
cd better-lbnl-os
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
from better_lbnl_os import fit_changepoint_model
import numpy as np

# Prepare temperature and energy data (showing heating and cooling patterns)
temperatures = np.array([30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85])  # °F
energy_use = np.array([150, 140, 125, 110, 95, 85, 80, 80, 85, 95, 110, 125])  # kBtu/day

# Fit change-point model
model_result = fit_changepoint_model(temperatures, energy_use)

# Check model quality
if model_result.is_valid():
    print(f"Model Type: {model_result.model_type}")  # 5P (heating and cooling)
    print(f"R-squared: {model_result.r_squared:.3f}")  # 0.995
    print(f"Baseload: {model_result.baseload:.1f}")  # 80.0
```

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at [https://better-lbnl-os.readthedocs.io](https://better-lbnl-os.readthedocs.io)

### Key Concepts

- **Domain Models**: Rich objects that encapsulate both data and business logic
- **Pure Functions**: Mathematical algorithms implemented as side-effect-free functions
- **Service Layer**: Orchestration of complex workflows
- **Adapter Pattern**: Clean separation for framework integration
