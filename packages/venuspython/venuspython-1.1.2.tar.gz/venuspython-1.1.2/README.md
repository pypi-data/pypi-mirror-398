# Summary

VENUSpy is a Python-based implementation of the VENUS software for molecular dynamics and initial sampling. VENUS has been used by computational chemists to simulate real-life conditions with appropriate statistical ensembles. Depending on what ensemble you're interested in and how many trajectories you can simulate, you may need to adjust what kind of sampling you do!



# Example Usage

We suggest first-time users to use the command line interface (CLI) for simulations. It can be downloaded through git:

```
git clone https://github.com/kaka-zuumi/VENUSpy.git
```

Inside the downloaded folder, you can install VENUSpy with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package:

```
cd VENUSpy
pip install venuspython
pip install ase
```

The file `cli.py` can be run with your favourite Python environment so long as the appropriate packages can be installed; if installed with pip, then it can also be accessed with the alias `venuspy-cli`. Then, input files and command line arguments can be supplied to it.

There are three key features in VENUSpy:
- [Sampling Methods](#sampling-methods)
- [Potential Energy Surfaces](#potential-energy-surfaces)
- [Hybrid Potential](#hybrid-potential)



## Sampling Methods

To illustrate the difference that sampling can make, consider the dynamics of water molecules at room temperature. Chemical reactivity is typically controlled by the vibrational energy in the molecule's bonds. At room temperature (298K), nearly all H<sub>2</sub>O molecules will be in their vibrational ground state with 12.6372 kcal/mol of zero-point energy. We can compare vibrational energies of water sampled from:

- A 298K canonical ensemble 
- A 12.6372 kcal/mol microcanonical ensemble

We will also see how the sampling changes at higher excitations. For simplicity, you can use a fast generic software like xTB for these tests, which can be installed with:

```
pip install tblite
```

### Canonical Sampling

<details>
<summary>Click here to do the example</summary>

Water is a nonlinear molecule with three atoms, so it has three normal modes. The vibrational quanta of each mode will be sampled from a canonical ensemble with the `--INITQPa "thermal"` argument, which assumes energies in each mode are related by a temperature. The frequency of the modes dictates the distribution of quanta and their energies. With xTB, these frequencies are 3653 cm<sup>-1</sup> > 3645 cm<sup>-1</sup> > 1538 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the symmetric stretch, asymmetric stretch, and bending modes, respectively. VENUSpy can sample these with:

```
venuspy-cli examples/H2O.input.xyz examples/H2O.input.xtb .  --atomsInFirstGroup "1 2 3" --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "thermal" --TVIBa 298.0 --TROTa 0.001 --n_threads 1 > production.log
```

While tracking the normal mode breakdown of energies over the entire trajectory is slow (this requires a Hessian calculation at each step), this can be done for the first frame from the initial sampling. Search for the `EVIBS` keyword in the output to see energies of each mode (in eV).

```
grep "#VENUS EVIBS" production.log
```

When this is done repeatedly, we can get some statistical information by looking at the distribution of individual and total vibrational energies sampled.

<img align="center" width="600" height="250" src="images/canonical.298K.png">

The resulting distribution of vibrational energies in each mode is shown in the figure above. Nearly all molecules are in their ground vibrational state with energies of 0.23, 0.23, and 0.10 eV. This results in only a single possible combination of energies sampled. At higher temperatures, the higher vibrational states start to get populated. At 3000K, if we repeat the procedure with the argument `--TVIBa 3000.0`, we instead see a distribution as follows:

<img align="center" width="600" height="250" src="images/canonical.3000K.png">

</details>

### Microcanonical Sampling

<details>
<summary>Click here to do the example</summary>

Water is a nonlinear molecule with three atoms, so it has three normal modes. The vibrational energies of each mode will be sampled from a microcanonical ensemble with the `--INITQPa "microcanonical"` argument, which assumes uniform mixing of energies between all modes. The frequency of the modes dictates the absolute amount of energy ultimately given to a mode. With xTB, these frequencies are 3653 cm<sup>-1</sup> > 3645 cm<sup>-1</sup> > 1538 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the symmetric stretch, asymmetric stretch, and bending modes, respectively. VENUSpy can sample these with:

```
venuspy-cli examples/H2O.input.xyz examples/H2O.input.xtb .  --atomsInFirstGroup "1 2 3" --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "microcanonical" --EVIBa 12.6372 --EROTa 0.00001 --n_threads 1 > production.log
```

While tracking the normal mode breakdown of energies over the entire trajectory is slow (this requires a Hessian calculation at each step), this can be done for the first frame from the initial sampling. Search for the `EVIBS` keyword in the output to see energies of each mode (in eV).

```
grep "#VENUS EVIBS" production.log
```

When this is done repeatedly, we can get some statistical information by looking at the distribution of individual and total vibrational energies sampled.

<img align="center" width="600" height="250" src="images/microcanonical.12.63.png">

The resulting distribution of vibrational energies in each mode is shown in the figure above. Although only a single total vibrational energy is sampled, the energy is uniformly mixed over all three modes, resulting in a seemingly random distribution of combinations of energies. In this way, a microcanonical ensemble favors mixing mode energies over explicit quantizations. The same behaviour is seen at all excitations, including one corresponding to the average energy of the 3000K canonical ensemble (21.22 kcal/mol) from the previous example. If we repeat the procedure with the argument `--EVIBa 21.220`, we then see a distribution as follows:

<img align="center" width="600" height="250" src="images/microcanonical.21.22.png">

</details>

### Normal Mode Sampling

<details>
<summary>Click here to do the example</summary>

Water is a nonlinear molecule with three atoms, so it has three normal modes. If a specific amount of energy is needed to be sampled for each mode, then instead a microcanonical normal mode sampling can be done with the `--INITQPa "microcanonicalnormalmode"` argument. The frequency of the modes dictates the absolute amount of energy ultimately given to a mode. With xTB, these frequencies are 3653 cm<sup>-1</sup> > 3645 cm<sup>-1</sup> > 1538 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the symmetric stretch, asymmetric stretch, and bending modes, respectively. For example, for an equal-energy sampling, VENUSpy can sample these with:

```
venuspy-cli examples/H2O.input.xyz examples/H2O.input.xtb .  --atomsInFirstGroup "1 2 3" --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "microcanonicalnormalmode" --EVIBNMODESa 4.21,4.21,4.21 --EROTa 0.00001 --n_threads 1 > production.log
```

While tracking the normal mode breakdown of energies over the entire trajectory is slow (this requires a Hessian calculation at each step), this can be done for the first frame from the initial sampling. Search for the `EVIBS` keyword in the output to see energies of each mode (in eV).

```
grep "#VENUS EVIBS" production.log
```

When this is done repeatedly, we can get some statistical information by looking at the distribution of individual and total vibrational energies sampled. 

<img align="center" width="600" height="250" src="images/normalmode.1to1to1.12.63.png">

The resulting distribution of vibrational energies in each mode is shown in the figure above. Each mode is given a specific amount of energy so effectively a single state and total energy are sampled. However, the amount of energy is arbitrary and any mix can be requested. For example, if we repeat the procedure with the argument `--EVIBNMODESa X,Y,0.0` where X and Y are two random numbers that add to 12.63 kcal/mol, we then see a distribution as follows:

<img align="center" width="600" height="250" src="images/normalmode.RtoRto0.12.63.png">

</details>

### Semiclassical Sampling

Finally, there is one more special case for diatomic molecules. Because polyatomic molecules have multiple normal modes, experimentally there is often more leeway in assigning exact rovibrational states to molecules---a difficult and often intractable problem. However, diatomic molecules can have exact rovibrational states assigned through computational quantization procedures. The phase and kinetic/potential distribution of the vibration can then be sampled classically. This semiclassical method is the preferred sampling method for diatoms.

<details>
<summary>Click here to do an example</summary>

Let's do an example for the OH radical with the same software, for the N=2,J=5 rovibrational state:

```
venuspy-cli examples/OH.input.xyz examples/OH.input.xtb .  --atomsInFirstGroup "1 2" --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "semiclassical" --NVIBa 2 --NROTa 5 --n_threads 1 > production.log
```

Note that, with the semiclassical method, the rovibrational states' energies are not known a priori, as they are not approximated from the normal mode frequencies. Thus, only specific rovibrational states (N,J) can be sampled rather than ensembles. However, the ensemble of phases for a state are still sampled.

## Potential Energy Surfaces

To do any sampling or dynamics, a PES is necessary. Many options are available:

### MOPAC

<details>
<summary>Click here to expand the instructions</summary>

<img align="right" width="300" height="200" src="images/mopaclogo1.png">

To use MOPAC, it must first be installed somehow. On Ubuntu 24.0 for example, it can be installed with:

```
sudo apt install mopac
```

MOPAC is a general semiempirical software which means that it can be used for most reactions of interest. We will try it out on the B + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> reaction. The input files describing the geometry and PES are as follows:

<details>
<summary>B.C2H2.input.xyz</summary>

```text
5

B      0.000000    0.000000    0.000000
C     -1.707100    1.879500    0.000000
C     -0.611600    2.321200    0.000000
H      0.365700    2.747600    0.000000
H     -2.684400    1.453100    0.000000
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>B.C2H2.input.mopac</summary>

```text
           method AM1
           charge 0
     multiplicity 2
          maxiter 1500
```
</details>

Then, any initial sampling and MD parameters can be given to this so long as the B and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> are kept separate. For example, for a bimolecular collision initiated with 2.4 kcal/mol of collision energy and cold C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, the following command works:

```
venuspy-cli examples/B.C2H2.input.xyz examples/B.C2H2.input.mopac . --atomsInFirstGroup "1" --collisionEnergy 2.4 --impactParameter 1.0 --centerOfMassDistance 10.0 --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "thermal" --INITQPb "thermal" --TVIBa 300.0 --TROTa 300.0 --TVIBb 10.0 --TROTb 10.0 --n_threads 1 > production.log
```

Sometimes the SCF calculation in MOPAC does not converge which leads to the error: `ase.calculators.calculator.CalculationFailed: ... failed`. This happens about 1/5 times for this system; restarting it often resolves this.

</details>



### PSI4

<details>
<summary>Click here to expand the instructions</summary>

<img align="right" width="400" height="200" src="images/psi4logo1.png">

To use PSI4, it can be installed with `conda`. You can create a conda environment for it like so:

```
conda create --name psi4md psi4 ase -c conda-forge
conda activate psi4md
```

PSI4 is a general ab initio software which means that it can be used for any adiabatic reaction. Thus, it can be used for the same B + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> reaction. The same geometry file `B.C2H2.input.xyz` can be used, while the PES is altered as:

<details>
<summary>B.C2H2.input.xyz</summary>

```text

B      0.000000    0.000000    0.000000

C     -0.611600    2.321200    0.000000
H      0.365700    2.747600    0.000000
H     -2.684400    1.453100    0.000000
```
</details>

```text
referencemethod uhf
     psi4method b3lyp/def2-sv(p)
         charge 0
   multiplicity 2
```
</details>

Similar to the MOPAC implementation, any initial sampling and MD parameters can be given to this so long as the B and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> are kept separate. For example, for a bimolecular collision initiated with 2.4 kcal/mol of collision energy and cold C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, the following command works:

```
venuspy-cli examples/B.C2H2.input.xyz examples/B.C2H2.input.psi4 . --atomsInFirstGroup "1" --collisionEnergy 2.4 --impactParameter 1.0 --centerOfMassDistance 10.0 --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "thermal" --INITQPb "thermal" --TVIBa 300.0 --TROTa 300.0 --TVIBb 10.0 --TROTb 10.0 --n_threads 1 > production.log
```

While PSI4 is parallelized, it is a full electronic structure calculation so it takes more than a minute to do the molecular dynamics, let alone the initial sampling. By default, if there are convergence issues at any step of the initial sampling or dynamics, the ab initio calculation is restarted with slightly different or looser parameters. We suggest skipping a full trajectory simulation if trying this as a test.

### TBLite

<details>
<summary>Click here to expand the instructions</summary>

<img align="right" width="400" height="200" src="images/xtblogo1.png">

To use TBLite, it can be installed with `pip`, like so:

```
pip install tblite
```

TBLite is a light-weight implementation of the extended tight-binding (xTB) Hamiltonian, which is a generic enough framework for most chemical reactions. Thus, it can be used for the same B + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> reaction. The same geometry file `B.C2H2.input.xyz` can be used, while the PES is altered as:

Similar to the MOPAC implementation, any initial sampling and MD parameters can be given to this so long as the B and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> are kept separate. For example, for a bimolecular collision initiated with 2.4 kcal/mol of collision energy and cold C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, the following command works:

```
venuspy-cli examples/B.C2H2.input.xyz examples/B.C2H2.input.xtb . --atomsInFirstGroup "1" --collisionEnergy 2.4 --impactParameter 1.0 --centerOfMassDistance 10.0 --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "thermal" --INITQPb "thermal" --TVIBa 300.0 --TROTa 300.0 --TVIBb 10.0 --TROTb 10.0 --n_threads 1 > production.log
```

Sometimes the xTB calculation does not converge. By default, VENUSpy restarts the calculation a few times with slightly different parameters to try to save the trajectory.

</details>


### ChemPotPy

<details>
<summary>Click here to expand the instructions</summary>

To use ChemPotPy, the main package can be installed with `pip` and some helper packages must be installed with `conda`. As suggested by the developers, a new conda environment can be made for chempotpy with the appropriate packages installed like so:

```
conda create --name chempotpy
conda activate chempotpy
conda install python=3.11
conda install mkl mkl-service
conda install -c conda-forge gfortran
pip install numpy "numpy>=1.26,<1.27"
pip install charset_normalizer
pip install ase
pip install chempotpy
```

ChemPotPy is a collection of analytical potentials, originally made in Fortran and then packaged with a Python wrapper. Thus, only specific chemical reactions can be studied. We will try it out on the O + O2 reaction; find the full list of reactions available at: https://github.com/shuyinan/chempotpy.  The input files describing the geometry and PES are as follows:

<details>
<summary>O.O2.input.xyz</summary>

<summary>O.O2.input.chempotpy</summary>

```text
Q1-Sgm    chempotpy O3 O3_6_5Ap_2023 0
```
</details>

Then, any initial sampling and MD parameters can be given to this. For example, for a bimolecular collision initiated with 2.4 kcal/mol of collision energy and cold O2, the following command works:

```
venuspy-cli examples/O.O2.input.xyz examples/O.O2.input.chempotpy . --atomsInFirstGroup "1" --collisionEnergy 2.4 --impactParameter 1.0 --centerOfMassDistance 10.0 --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "thermal" --INITQPb "thermal" --TVIBa 300.0 --TROTa 300.0 --TVIBb 10.0 --TROTb 10.0 --n_threads 1 > production.log

### Python-Based ML Potentials

<details>

<img align="right" width="300" height="200" src="images/tensorflowlogo1.jpg">
</p>

Many Python-based machine learning (ML) potentials exist now and because of the variety of different ML software, there may be conflicts between installed software. It is suggested to always create separate `conda` environments for each software. If `pip` is being used, separate Python virtual environments can be used for each software as well.

We will demonstrate interfaces with three examples: Schnet, sGDML, and Physnet.

For Schnet, first install an appropriate version (depending on the version of the model):

```
python3.11 -m venv .schnetmd
source .schnetmd/bin/activate
pip install torch==2.3 schnetpack==2.0.4 pytorch-lightning==2.2
pip install ase venuspython
```

And then do the initial sampling and MD:

```
venuspy-cli examples/CH.C4H6.input.xyz examples/MLmodels/CHC4H6/best_inference_model . --atomsInFirstGroup "1 2" --collisionEnergy 2.4 --impactParameter 1.0 --centerOfMassDistance 10.0 --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "thermal" --INITQPb "thermal" --TVIBa 300.0 --TROTa 300.0 --TVIBb 10.0 --TROTb 10.0 --n_threads 1 > production.log
```


For sGDML, first install the latest version with `pip`:

```
python -m venv .sgdmlmd
source .sgdmlmd/bin/activate
pip install sgdml
pip install ase venuspython
```

And then do the initial sampling and MD:

```
venuspy-cli examples/HBr.HCl.input.xyz examples/MLmodels/HBrHCl/model-train8000-sym2-sig0050.npz . --atomsInFirstGroup "1 2" --collisionEnergy 2.4 --impactParameter 1.0 --centerOfMassDistance 10.0 --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "thermal" --INITQPb "thermal" --TVIBa 300.0 --TROTa 300.0 --TVIBb 10.0 --TROTb 10.0 --n_threads 1 > production.log
```

For Physnet, first download the latest version from github and install tensorflow:

```
git clone https://github.com/MMunibas/PhysNet.git
conda create -n tensorflow1.14 tensorflow=1.14
conda activate tensorflow1.14
conda install ase -c conda-forge
```

You may need to change a few lines of code so that it works (there seem to be some backward compatability issues):

```
sed -i 's/import tensorflow as tf/import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf/' PhysNet/*.py PhysNet/*/*.py PhysNet/*/*/*.py
sed -i 's/self._saver = tf.train.Saver(self.variables, save_relative_paths=True, max_to_keep=50)/self._saver = tf.train.Saver(max_to_keep=50)/' PhysNet/neural_network/NeuralNetwork.py
sed -i 's/@lru_cache/@lru_cache(maxsize=128)/' $(dirname $(which python))/../lib/python3.7/site-packages/ase/formula.py
sed -i 's/from importlib.metadata import entry_points/from importlib_metadata import entry_points/' $(dirname $(which python))/../lib/python3.7/site-packages/ase/io/formats.py
```

And then do the initial sampling and MD:

```
venuspy-cli examples/CH.SH2.input.xyz examples/MLmodels/CHSH2/model.physnet.config . --atomsInFirstGroup "1 2" --collisionEnergy 2.4 --impactParameter 1.0 --centerOfMassDistance 10.0 --production 100 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "thermal" --INITQPb "thermal" --TVIBa 300.0 --TROTa 300.0 --TVIBb 10.0 --TROTb 10.0 --n_threads 1 > production.log 2> /dev/null
```

</details>




## Hybrid Potential

See the attached manuscript to see details of when and how to use a hybrid potential energy surface. In general, an ab initio method would be combined with a ML method. Right now, the only ML method it is implemented with is sGDML (due to the ease in retraining it on-the-fly). For the ab initio method, let's test this out on one of the simplest non-analytical potentials, xTB. First, install both software:

```
python -m venv .hybridmd
source .hybridmd/bin/activate
pip install sgdml
pip install tblite
pip install ase venuspython
```

Add the argument `--MDtype "smoothed"` and you're good to go:

```
venuspy-cli examples/B.C2H2.input.xyz examples/B.C2H2.input.xtb . --MDtype "smoothed" --atomsInFirstGroup "1" --collisionEnergy 2.4 --impactParameter 1.0 --centerOfMassDistance 10.0 --production 5000 --interval 1 --time_step 0.15 --INITQPa "thermal" --INITQPb "thermal" --TVIBa 300.0 --TROTa 300.0 --TVIBb 10.0 --TROTb 10.0 --n_threads 1 > production.log
```

The xTB software, although not a completely ab initio theory, uses similar kinds of SCF methods and also runs into convergence problems. Over the course of the 5000 steps simulated, it often will have two or three energy drift/jump issues. When this happens, the sGDML surface quickly trains on the local surface and tries to save the trajectory. After some number of steps, the xTB method takes over again.

While basically irrelevant for xTB, this ability to save a higher level calculation is of great import to expensive methods like true ab initio calculations with DZ or TZ basis sets.
