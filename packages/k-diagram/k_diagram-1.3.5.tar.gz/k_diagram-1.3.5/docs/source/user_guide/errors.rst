Visualizing Forecast Errors
=======================================

A crucial part of model evaluation is the direct analysis of its
errors. While uncertainty visualizations focus on the predicted range,
error visualizations focus on the discrepancy between the point
forecast and the actual outcome (:math:`e = y_{true} - \hat{y}_{pred}`).
A thorough error analysis can reveal systemic biases, inconsistencies,
and opportunities for model improvement.

The :mod:`kdiagram.plot.errors` module provides specialized polar plots
to diagnose and compare model errors in an intuitive, visual manner.

Detailed Explanations
-----------------------

Let's explore these functions in detail.

.. _ug_plot_error_bands:

Systemic vs. Random Error (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.errors.plot_error_bands`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This plot is designed to decompose a model's error into two components:
**systemic error (bias)** and **random error (variance)**. It achieves
this by aggregating errors across bins of an angular variable (like
the month of the year or hour of the day) and displaying the mean and
standard deviation of the errors in each bin :footcite:p:`kouadiob2025`.

**Mathematical Concept:**
The function first partitions the dataset into :math:`K` bins,
:math:`B_k`, based on the ``theta_col`` values.

1. **Mean Error (Bias):** For each bin :math:`B_k`, the mean error
   :math:`\mu_{e,k}` is calculated. This represents the average bias
   of the model under the conditions of that bin.

   .. math::

      \mu_{e,k} = \frac{1}{|B_k|} \sum_{i \in B_k} e_i

   where :math:`e_i` is the error of sample :math:`i`. This is plotted
   as the central black line.

2. **Error Variance:** The standard deviation of the error,
   :math:`\sigma_{e,k}`, is calculated for each bin. This measures the
   consistency or random scatter of the errors.

   .. math::

      \sigma_{e,k} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{|B_k|-1} \sum_{i \in B_k} (e_i - \mu_{e,k})^2}

3. **Error Band:** A shaded band is drawn around the mean error line,
   with its boundaries defined as:

   .. math::

      \text{Bounds}_k = \mu_{e,k} \pm n_{std} \cdot \sigma_{e,k}

   The width of this band is a direct visualization of the model's
   random error.

**Interpretation:**

* **Mean Error Line (Bias):** If this line deviates from the "Zero Error"
  reference circle, the model has a systemic bias in that angular region.
  An outward deviation means over-prediction on average; an inward
  deviation means under-prediction.
* **Shaded Band (Variance):** A wide band indicates high variance, meaning
  the model's predictions are inconsistent and unreliable in that region.
  A narrow band indicates consistent, low-variance errors.

**Use Cases:**

* Diagnosing if a model's bias is dependent on a cyclical feature like
  seasonality or time of day.
* Identifying conditions under which a model's performance becomes
  unstable or inconsistent.
* Separating reducible systemic errors (bias) from irreducible random
  errors (variance) to guide model improvement efforts.

You've just seen the theory behind decomposing errors into bias and
variance. Now, let's put this powerful diagnostic tool to work. The
following example simulates a common forecasting challenge where a
model's performance is not constant, illustrating where this plot
truly shines.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   An energy company uses a model to forecast electricity demand for the
   next day. They suspect the model's accuracy changes depending on the
   time of day—performing well overnight but struggling during the peak
   demand hours of the late afternoon.

   An error band plot is the perfect diagnostic tool for this. It can
   show the mean error (bias) and error variance (consistency) for each
   hour, wrapped around a 24-hour circle, to instantly reveal
   time-dependent patterns in the model's performance.

      Polar error bands revealing how a forecast's mean error (bias)
      and variance change depending on the hour of the day.

   This visualization wraps the entire 24-hour error cycle into a single
   view. By examining the central line's distance from the "Zero Error"
   circle and the width of the shaded band, we can pinpoint exactly when
   our forecast is least reliable.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    The plot immediately reveals that the model's performance is not
    constant, but rather exhibits a strong time-dependent pattern. An
    analysis of the mean error (the black line) shows a systemic bias
    that shifts throughout the day; for instance, the model tends to
    under-predict in the early morning hours, while it consistently
    over-predicts in the afternoon. In addition to this changing bias,
    the model's consistency also varies significantly. The width of the
    shaded variance band is much larger during the evening and night,
    indicating that the model's predictions are highly inconsistent
    and unreliable during these periods.

This plot effectively diagnoses that the model has a time-dependent
bias and is far less consistent at certain times of the day. To
reproduce this diagnostic plot, explore the full example in the gallery.

.. _ug_plot_error_violins:

Comparing Error Distributions (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.errors.plot_error_violins`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function provides a direct visual comparison of the **full error
distributions** for multiple models on a single polar plot. It adapts the
traditional violin plot (:footcite:t:`Hintze1998`) to a polar coordinate system,
to show the shape, bias, and variance of each model's errors, making it an
excellent tool for model selection.

**Mathematical Concept:**
For each model's error data, a **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)** is
computed to create a smooth representation of its probability density
function, :math:`\hat{f}_h(x)`.

.. math::

   \hat{f}_h(x) = \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^{n} K\left(\frac{x - x_i}{h}\right)

This density curve is then plotted symmetrically around a radial axis to
form the "violin" shape. The width of the violin at any error value
:math:`x` is proportional to the probability density :math:`\hat{f}_h(x)`.
Each model is assigned its own angular sector on the polar plot.

**Interpretation:**

* **Bias (Centering):** The location of the widest part of the violin
  relative to the "Zero Error" circle reveals the model's bias. A violin
  centered on the circle is unbiased. A violin shifted outward indicates
  a positive bias (over-prediction), while a shift inward indicates a
  negative bias (under-prediction).
* **Variance (Width/Height):** A short, wide violin signifies a
  high-variance model with inconsistent errors. A tall, narrow violin
  signifies a low-variance model with consistent performance.
* **Shape:** The shape of the violin reveals further details. An
  asymmetric shape indicates skewed errors. Multiple wide sections
  (bimodality) suggest the model makes two or more common types of errors.

**Use Cases:**

* Directly comparing the overall performance of multiple candidate models.
* Selecting a model based on a holistic view of its error profile
  (e.g., choosing a slightly biased but highly consistent model over an
  unbiased but inconsistent one).
* Presenting a summary of comparative model performance to stakeholders.

Now that you understand the mathematical concept behind polar violins,
let's see them in action. This practical example will show you how to
turn abstract error data from competing models into a clear,
comparative visualization, making model selection much more intuitive.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Imagine a financial firm has built three different models (A, B, and C)
   to predict a client's credit score. To choose the best one, they need
   to compare the entire *distribution* of prediction errors. A model
   that is unbiased on average but makes occasional huge errors could be
   very risky.

   A polar violin plot allows for a direct, side-by-side comparison of
   the shape, bias, and variance of each model's errors on a single,
   intuitive chart.

      :alt: Polar violin plots comparing three model error distributions.

      A polar violin plot comparing the error distributions of three
      competing models, revealing differences in their bias and variance.

   The resulting plot arranges the error profile of each model into a
   clear, comparative layout. Let's dissect these violin shapes to see
   which model is truly the most reliable.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This plot provides a rich, comparative view of the three distinct
    error profiles. Model 2 (Green) clearly emerges as the best
    performer, as its violin is both tall, narrow, and centered on the
    "Zero Error" line, indicating an ideal combination of low bias and
    low variance. In contrast, Model 1 (Purple) presents a trade-off;
    while its narrow shape demonstrates high consistency (low
    variance), its outward shift reveals a systemic positive bias.
    Model 3 (Red) showcases the opposite problem. Although it appears
    unbiased on average with its center near zero, its extremely wide
    shape and long tail signify dangerously high variance, making it
    unreliable and prone to large, unpredictable errors.

This direct visual comparison makes model selection much clearer than
relying on single-score metrics. To see the full implementation,
please refer to the gallery example.

.. _ug_plot_error_ellipses:

Visualizing 2D Uncertainty (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.errors.plot_error_ellipses`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function is designed for visualizing **two-dimensional uncertainty**,
a concept explored in :footcite:t:`kouadiob2025`, which is common in spatial
or positional forecasting. It draws an ellipse for each data point, where
the ellipse's size and orientation represent the uncertainty in both the
radial and angular directions.

**Mathematical Concept:**
For each data point :math:`i`, we have a mean position
:math:`(\mu_{r,i}, \mu_{\theta,i})` and the standard deviations of the
errors in those directions, :math:`\sigma_{r,i}` and
:math:`\sigma_{\theta,i}`.

The ellipse is defined by its half-width (in the radial direction) and
half-height (in the tangential direction):

.. math::

   \text{width} &= n_{std} \cdot \sigma_{r,i} \\
   \text{height} &= n_{std} \cdot (\mu_{r,i} \cdot \sin(\sigma_{\theta,i}))

The ellipse is then rotated by the angle :math:`\mu_{\theta,i}` and
translated to its mean position on the polar plot. The area of the
ellipse represents the confidence region (e.g., :math:`n_{std}=2`
approximates a 95% confidence region).

**Interpretation:**

* **Ellipse Position:** The center of the ellipse marks the mean predicted
  location.
* **Ellipse Size:** A larger ellipse indicates greater overall positional
  uncertainty.
* **Ellipse Shape (Eccentricity):** The shape reveals the nature of the
  uncertainty. A circular ellipse means the error is similar in all
  directions. An elongated ellipse indicates that the error is much
  larger in one direction (e.g., radial) than the other (e.g., angular).

**Use Cases:**

* Visualizing the uncertainty in tracking applications (e.g., predicting
  the future position of a vehicle or storm).
* Understanding the directionality of spatial forecast errors.
* Assessing the positional accuracy of simulation models.

The concept of two-dimensional positional uncertainty can seem
abstract. Let's ground it in a tangible, high-stakes application.
This example will demonstrate how to use error ellipses to visualize
the uncertainty in hurricane track forecasting, making complex data
much more intuitive.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   A meteorological agency tracks hurricanes. Their models predict a
   storm's future position in terms of distance and direction from a
   reference point, along with the uncertainty (standard deviation) for
   both of these measurements. Visualizing this two-dimensional
   uncertainty is critical for issuing effective public warnings.

   A polar error ellipse plot is the ideal way to visualize this 2D
   positional uncertainty. Each ellipse can represent the confidence
   region for a tracked storm's predicted location, with its color
   indicating the storm's intensity.

      95% confidence ellipses visualizing the two-dimensional
      positional uncertainty for multiple hurricane track forecasts,
      colored by storm intensity.

   Each ellipse on this plot represents a 95% confidence region for a
   hurricane's predicted position. The size, shape, and color of these
   ellipses tell a rich story about the forecast's reliability. Let's
   analyze them in detail.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This plot offers a multi-faceted view of the two-dimensional
    positional uncertainty in the forecasts. The magnitude of this
    uncertainty is directly conveyed by the **size** of the ellipses,
    which vary dramatically from small, confident predictions (purple)
    to large regions of uncertainty (yellow). Moreover, the **shape**
    of the ellipses reveals the nature of the error; nearly circular
    ellipses indicate uniform uncertainty, whereas elongated ones show
    that the error is much greater in one direction (e.g., distance)
    than the other (e.g., direction). Finally, the **color** provides a
    key physical insight, showing a clear correlation between storm
    intensity and forecast uncertainty, as the higher-category storms
    (yellow) correspond to the largest ellipses.

This visualization communicates complex, two-dimensional
error data. For a complete, step-by-step example, please see the
full implementation in the gallery.
