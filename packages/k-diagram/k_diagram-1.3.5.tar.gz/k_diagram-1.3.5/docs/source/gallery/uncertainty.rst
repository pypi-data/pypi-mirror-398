Uncertainty Visualizations
==============================

This page showcases examples of plots specifically designed for
exploring, diagnosing, and communicating aspects of predictive
uncertainty using `k-diagram`.

.. note::
   You need to run the code snippets locally to generate the plot
   images referenced below (e.g., ``../images/gallery_actual_vs_predicted.png``).
   Ensure the image paths in the ``.. image::`` directives match where
   you save the plots (likely an ``images`` subdirectory relative to
   this file, e.g., `../images/`).

.. _gallery_plot_actual_vs_predicted: 

----------------------
Actual vs. Predicted
----------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_actual_vs_predicted` function
is the foundational tool for forecast evaluation. It creates a direct,
point-by-point comparison of observed outcomes against a model's central
prediction, providing an immediate and intuitive assessment of accuracy
and bias.

Before diving into complex diagnostics, it is essential to master the
anatomy of this plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents the sample's position in the dataset,
     arranged sequentially around the circle. If a ``theta_col`` is
     provided in a future version, it could represent an explicit
     ordering variable like time or a spatial coordinate.
   * **Radius (r):** Directly corresponds to the **magnitude** of the
     value. Both the ``actual_col`` and ``pred_col`` are plotted on
     this axis, allowing for a direct comparison of their magnitudes at
     each angular position.
   * **Azimuth:** The azimuth (the circular path at a constant radius)
     does not represent a specific metric itself, but tracing it helps
     in comparing how predictions and actuals change relative to each
     other across the dataset.

Now, let's explore how to apply this plot to a real-world scenario,
progressing from a basic check to a more advanced, customized
visualization.

**Use Case 1: A Basic "Sanity Check"**

The most fundamental use of this plot is as a "sanity check" for a
single model. After training, you need an immediate visual answer to the
question: "Is my model's forecast even in the right ballpark?" By
plotting the predictions as points against the true values, we can get
a quick, high-level sense of the model's performance.

   # Simulate a cyclical signal (e.g., seasonal sales) with some noise
   np.random.seed(66)
   n_points = 120
   signal = 20 + 15 * np.cos(np.linspace(0, 6 * np.pi, n_points))
   df_basic = pd.DataFrame({
       'actual_sales': signal + np.random.randn(n_points) * 3,
       'predicted_sales': signal * 0.9 + np.random.randn(n_points) * 2 + 2

   A point-by-point comparison where black dots represent actual
   sales and red crosses represent the model's predictions.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot provides a direct, sample-by-sample comparison. The black
   dots (actuals) and red crosses (predictions) form clear cyclical
   patterns, indicating the model has successfully captured the main
   seasonal trend. We can see that the predictions generally track the
   actual values, but with some scatter. In some areas, particularly
   at the peaks of the cycle (outer radius), the red crosses appear to
   be systematically inside the cloud of black dots, hinting at a
   potential under-prediction bias. This initial check confirms the
   model is reasonable but warrants a closer look.

**Use Case 2: Comparing Competing Models with Lines**

A more advanced and common task is to compare the performance of two
or more competing models. By plotting their predictions as continuous
lines, we can better visualize and contrast their tracking behavior and
systemic biases.

Let's imagine we have our original model ("Biased Model") and a new,
improved model ("Tracking Model"). We want to see if the new model
corrects the under-prediction bias we suspected in the first use case.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Add a second model's prediction to our DataFrame ---
   # (Assumes df_basic from the previous step is available)
   df_multi = df_basic.copy()
   df_multi['tracking_model'] = df_multi['actual_sales'] + np.random.normal(0, 1.5, n_points)
   df_multi.rename(columns={'predicted_sales': 'biased_model'}, inplace=True)

   # --- 2. Plotting with Lines for Comparison ---
   # Note: This function is designed for one prediction column. To compare
   # multiple, we would typically call it multiple times on the same axes
   # or use a different plot. For this example, we will create two separate plots.
   # (This is a good place to show how to use the function twice if needed)

   fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 8),
                                subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
   
   # after creating ax1, ax2, let extend re-position r default
   for a in (ax1, ax2):
       a.set_ylabel(None)
       a.set_rlabel_position(225)
       
   # Plot for the Biased Model
   kd.plot_actual_vs_predicted(
       df=df_multi,
       actual_col='actual_sales',
       pred_col='biased_model',
       title='Biased Model Performance',
       show_legend=False, 
       ax= ax1
   )
   ax1.set_ylabel("Sales Volume", labelpad=32)

       title='Improved Tracking Model Performance',
       pred_props={'color': '#38A169'}, # Green for the good model

   )

   Side-by-side comparison. The left plot shows a biased model with a
   prediction line that does not fully match the actuals. The right
   plot shows an improved model where the lines overlap almost perfectly.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   The side-by-side comparison makes the performance difference
   crystal clear. The **Biased Model** (left) shows a red prediction
   spiral that is visibly smoother and has a smaller amplitude than the
   black actuals spiral, confirming a systematic under-prediction
   bias at the peaks. In contrast, the **Improved Tracking Model**
   (right) shows a green prediction spiral that almost perfectly
   overlays the black actuals spiral, demonstrating its superior
   accuracy and lack of significant bias.

**Use Case 3: Focused Analysis with Custom Styling**

Sometimes, you need to create a presentation-ready plot that focuses
on a specific segment of your data, such as a critical business season.
By using the ``acov`` (angular coverage) parameter and customizing the
plot properties, we can create a more targeted and visually polished
diagnostic.

Let's focus on the first half of our sales cycle using a half-circle
layout to make the details easier to see.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Use the multi-model DataFrame from the previous step ---
   # (Assumes df_multi is available, i.e from the previous step)

   # --- 2. Create a focused and styled plot ---
   kd.plot_actual_vs_predicted(
       df=df_multi.head(60), # Focus on the first half of the cycle
       actual_col='actual_sales',
       pred_col='tracking_model',
       acov='half_circle', # Use a 180-degree layout
       title='Use Case 3: Focused Analysis (First 60 Samples)',
       r_label="Sales Volume",
       actual_props={'color': '#2D3748', 'linewidth': 2.5, 'label': 'Actual Sales'},
       pred_props={'color': '#38A169', 'linewidth': 2.5, 'linestyle': '--', 'label': 'Forecast'},
       savefig="gallery/images/gallery_avp_focused.png"

   :alt: A half-circle polar plot showing a focused view with custom styling.

   A styled, half-circle plot focusing on a specific period, with
   thicker, custom-colored lines for better presentation.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   By limiting the angular coverage to a half-circle and using only the
   first 60 data points, the plot becomes less cluttered and easier to
   inspect in detail. The custom styling—using thicker, dashed, and
   differently colored lines—enhances its readability, making it ideal
   for inclusion in a report or presentation. This focused view
   reaffirms the excellent tracking performance of the improved model
   during this specific period.

you may refer to the main :ref:`ug_actual_vs_predicted` section.

.. _gallery_plot_anomaly_magnitude:

-------------------
Anomaly Magnitude
-------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_anomaly_magnitude` function
is a specialized diagnostic tool that focuses exclusively on forecast
failures. It filters out all successful predictions and creates a polar
scatter plot of only the "anomalies"—cases where the true value fell
outside the predicted uncertainty interval. This allows for a detailed
investigation into the location, type, and severity of a model's most
significant errors.

First, let's understand the key components of this specialized plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents the sample's position in the dataset. By
     default, it is based on the DataFrame index, but if ``theta_col``
     is provided, the points are ordered according to that column's
     values. This can reveal if failures are clustered in time or space.
   * **Radius (r):** Directly corresponds to the **severity** of the
     anomaly, calculated as the absolute distance from the true value
     to the prediction interval boundary that was breached
     (:math:`|y_{actual} - y_{bound}|`). Points far from the center
     represent critical failures.
   * **Color:** Distinguishes the **type** of anomaly. The plot uses
     separate colormaps (``cmap_over`` and ``cmap_under``) to instantly
     differentiate between over-predictions (e.g., actual > Q90) and
     under-predictions (e.g., actual < Q10).

Now, let's apply this diagnostic to a few real-world scenarios to see
how it can be used to generate critical insights.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Balanced Anomalies in Financial Forecasting**

In many forecasting problems, we expect anomalies to be somewhat
symmetrical. For a well-calibrated model predicting stock returns, for
instance, the number and magnitude of unexpectedly large gains (over-
predictions) should be similar to the number and magnitude of
unexpectedly large losses (under-predictions). This first example
simulates such a balanced scenario.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # --- 1. Data Generation: Balanced Anomalies ---
   np.random.seed(42)
   n_points = 200
   df = pd.DataFrame({'trading_day': range(n_points)})
   df['actual_return'] = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1.5, size=n_points)
   # A well-calibrated 80% interval
   df['q10'] = -1.28 * 1.5
   df['q90'] = 1.28 * 1.5
   # Manually add some large, symmetric anomalies
   anomaly_indices = np.random.choice(n_points, 40, replace=False)
   df.loc[anomaly_indices, 'actual_return'] = np.random.choice([-1, 1], 40) * np.random.uniform(2.5, 5, 40)

   :width: 70%
   :alt: A polar plot showing a balanced distribution of red (over) and blue (under) anomalies.

   A balanced set of anomalies, with roughly equal numbers of
   over-predictions (red) and under-predictions (blue) distributed at
   various magnitudes.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot reveals that the model's interval failures are balanced.
   There are roughly equal numbers of over-predictions (red dots, where
   the actual return was higher than the predicted maximum) and
   under-predictions (blue dots, where the actual return was lower than
   the predicted minimum). The magnitudes (radii) of these failures are
   also fairly symmetrical. This is the signature of a model whose
   uncertainty is unbiased, even if the number of anomalies (40 out of
   200, or 20%) is exactly what you would expect from an 80% prediction
   interval.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 2: Asymmetric Risk in Supply Chain Management**

Not all anomalies are created equal. In many business contexts, one
type of error is far more costly than the other. This plot is an
excellent tool for diagnosing such asymmetric risks.

Consider a model forecasting the arrival time of shipments. A shipment
arriving a day early (an under-prediction) is a minor inconvenience. A
shipment arriving a day late (an over-prediction) can halt a production
line and be extremely costly. We need to check if our model is prone to
the more dangerous type of error.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation: Asymmetric Anomalies ---
   np.random.seed(0)
   n_points = 200
   df_shipping = pd.DataFrame({'shipment_id': range(n_points)})
   df_shipping['actual_arrival_day'] = np.random.uniform(5, 10, n_points)
   df_shipping['q10_arrival'] = df_shipping['actual_arrival_day'] - 1
   df_shipping['q90_arrival'] = df_shipping['actual_arrival_day'] + 1
   # Manually add mostly LATE arrivals (over-predictions)
   late_indices = np.random.choice(n_points, 35, replace=False)
   early_indices = np.random.choice(list(set(range(n_points)) - set(late_indices)), 5, replace=False)
   df_shipping.loc[late_indices, 'actual_arrival_day'] += np.random.uniform(1.5, 4, 35)
   df_shipping.loc[early_indices, 'actual_arrival_day'] -= np.random.uniform(1.5, 4, 5)

   # --- 2. Plotting ---
   kd.plot_anomaly_magnitude(
       df=df_shipping,
       actual_col='actual_arrival_day',
       q_cols=['q10_arrival', 'q90_arrival'],
       title='Use Case 2: Asymmetric Risk in Shipping Forecasts',

   )

.. figure:: ../images/uncertainty/gallery_anomaly_magnitude_asymmetric.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: A polar plot dominated by red (over-prediction) anomalies.

   An asymmetric distribution of anomalies, where costly late arrivals
   (red dots) are far more frequent and severe than early arrivals
   (blue dots).

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot immediately reveals a critical flaw in the forecasting
   model. The anomalies are overwhelmingly red, indicating that when
   the model fails, it is almost always because the shipment arrived
   **later** than the predicted window. Furthermore, several of these
   red points are at a large radius, indicating severe delays of 3-4
   days. This plot provides a clear, data-driven warning that the model
   is too optimistic and exposes the company to significant risk from
   late shipments.

.. _gallery_plot_overall_coverage:

------------------
Overall Coverage
------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage` function provides
a high-level summary of a model's reliability. It calculates the
**empirical coverage rate**—the percentage of times the true value
actually falls within a model's predicted interval—and visualizes this
score for one or more models, making it an essential first-pass check
for forecast calibration.

Before we explore its use, let's break down the anatomy of its most
distinct visualization: the radar plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy (Radar Chart)
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Each angular sector is assigned to a different
     **model** or prediction set provided to the function.
   * **Radius (r):** Directly corresponds to the calculated **coverage
     score**, ranging from 0 at the center to 1 (100%) at the outer
     edge.
   * **Azimuth:** The azimuth, or the circular path, represents a line
     of constant coverage. The plot's grid lines are drawn at specific
     coverage levels (e.g., 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) to serve as a reference.

With this in mind, let's walk through several real-world scenarios to
see how this function can be applied.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Basic Comparison with a Bar Chart**

The simplest way to compare the overall coverage of a few models is with
a standard bar chart. It provides a clean, straightforward view of the
final scores.

Let's imagine a financial analyst is comparing two models that predict
an 80% confidence interval for a stock's daily return. They need a
quick, unambiguous visualization to see which model's interval is more
reliable.

.. code-block:: python

   This bar chart provides a clear and immediate result for the 80%
   nominal interval. **Model A** achieves a coverage of **83%**, which
   is very close to the 80% target, indicating it is **well-calibrated**.
   In contrast, **Model B** has a much lower coverage of **48%**,
   revealing that it is severely **over-confident**—its prediction
   intervals are far too narrow and fail to capture the true outcome
   more than half the time. For a reliable forecast, Model A is the
   clear choice.

**Use Case 2: Multi-Model Profile with a Radar Chart**

When comparing three or more models, a radar chart can provide a more
holistic "profile" view. It's particularly effective for showing how
different models perform relative to the ideal 100% coverage limit and
to each other.

Let's expand our analysis to include a third model that is
**under-confident** (its intervals are too wide).

   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation (assumes previous data is available) ---
   # Model C (under-confident -> intervals are too wide)
   s_pred_C = 1.5 * sigma_mu
   q10_C = mu - z80 * s_pred_C
   q90_C = mu + z80 * s_pred_C
   y_pred_C = np.stack([q10_C, q90_C], axis=1)

   towards the center, showing its low coverage and confirming it is
   **over-confident**. Conversely, the point for **Model C** is pushed far
   out towards the 1.0 boundary, clearly visualizing its
   **under-confidence** and excessively wide intervals.

When you want to focus on the performance of a single, primary model,
the radar plot with ``cov_fill=True`` creates a special visualization
with a radial gradient. This provides a visually appealing way to
show a single score against the [0, 1] scale.

Let's create a presentation-ready plot for our best model, Model A.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Use the well-calibrated Model A from the previous step ---

   This focused view is excellent for reports. The green radial
   gradient fills the polar area up to the model's calculated coverage
   score, which is marked by the solid red circle. The concentric
   gray grid lines provide a clear scale. In this case, we can see the
   red circle sits very close to the 0.8 grid line, providing a
   visually unmistakable confirmation that the model is
   **well-calibrated** against its 80% nominal target.

Coverage Diagnostic
---------------------

While an overall coverage score tells us *if* a model is reliable on
average, the :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage_diagnostic`
function tells us *when* and *where* it might be failing. It provides a
granular, point-by-point report card of a model's prediction
intervals, making it an indispensable tool for uncovering hidden
patterns in forecast reliability.

Let's begin by dissecting the components of this diagnostic plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents each individual **sample's position** in
     the dataset, arranged sequentially around the circle. If the data
     is a time series, the angle effectively represents time. Since this
     can make the plot busy, the angular tick labels are often hidden
     by default (``mask_angle=True``).
   * **Radius (r):** Represents the **binary coverage status** for each
     sample. A radius of **1** means the actual value was successfully
     *inside* the prediction interval. A radius of **0** means the
     actual value was *outside* the interval (a failure).
   * **Reference Line:** A solid circular line is drawn at a radius
     equal to the **overall average coverage rate**, providing an
     immediate benchmark for the model's aggregate performance.

Now, let's apply this plot to a real-world problem to see how it can
reveal critical insights that an aggregate score would miss.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Basic Diagnostic with Random Failures**

The most common use case is to check if a model's interval failures
are randomly distributed, as they should be for a well-calibrated
model. A random scattering of failures around the circle is the
hallmark of a reliable forecast.

Let's simulate a forecast where the prediction intervals fail randomly
about 10% of the time.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # --- 1. Data Generation: Random Failures ---
   np.random.seed(88)
   n_points = 250
   df = pd.DataFrame({'point_id': range(n_points)})
   df['actual_val'] = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=n_points)
   # An interval that should cover ~90% of the data
   df['q_lower'] = df['actual_val'] - 3.2
   df['q_upper'] = df['actual_val'] + 3.2
   # Introduce random failures
   fail_indices = np.random.choice(n_points, 25, replace=False)
   df.loc[fail_indices, 'actual_val'] = 20

   # --- 2. Plotting with Scatter Points ---

       # savefig="gallery/images/gallery_coverage_diagnostic_scatter.png" or use kd.savefig (...)
   )
   kd.savefig("gallery/images/gallery_coverage_diagnostic_scatter.png")

   :width: 70%
   :alt: A coverage diagnostic plot showing random failures as points at radius 0.

   A diagnostic plot where successful coverages are green dots at
   radius 1, and failures are red dots at radius 0. The failures are
   scattered randomly.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot provides a point-wise report card. The vast majority of
   points are green and lie on the outer circle at **radius 1**,
   indicating successful coverage. The few red points at **radius 0**
   represent the interval failures. Critically, these red points are
   **scattered randomly** around the circle, with no obvious clusters or
   patterns. The solid orange line, representing the average coverage,
   sits at a radius of 0.90, confirming the model is well-calibrated.
   This random scatter of failures is the signature of a healthy,
   reliable model.

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 2: Diagnosing Seasonal Model Failure**

A model's greatest weakness is often hidden in patterns. An aggregate
coverage score might look good, but what if all the failures occur
during a specific, critical season? This is a common and dangerous
problem that this diagnostic plot is perfectly designed to uncover.

Let's simulate a weather forecast model that is reliable most of the
year but systematically fails during the summer heatwaves.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation: Seasonal Failures ---
   np.random.seed(42)
   n_days = 365
   days_of_year = np.arange(n_days)
   df_seasonal = pd.DataFrame({'day': days_of_year})
   df_seasonal['actual_temp'] = 15 + 10 * np.sin(days_of_year * 2 * np.pi / 365) + np.random.normal(0, 2, n_days)
   # Model produces intervals that are too narrow only during summer (days 150-240)
   interval_width = np.ones(n_days) * 8
   interval_width[(days_of_year > 150) & (days_of_year < 240)] = 3
   df_seasonal['q10_temp'] = df_seasonal['actual_temp'] - interval_width
   df_seasonal['q90_temp'] = df_seasonal['actual_temp'] + interval_width
   # Manually push some summer actuals outside the narrow bounds
   summer_indices = np.where((days_of_year > 150) & (days_of_year < 240))[0]
   fail_indices = np.random.choice(summer_indices, 40, replace=False)
   df_seasonal.loc[fail_indices, 'actual_temp'] += 5

   # --- 2. Plotting with Bars for emphasis ---
   kd.plot_coverage_diagnostic(
       df=df_seasonal,
       actual_col='actual_temp',
       q_cols=['q10_temp', 'q90_temp'],
       title='Use Case 2: Diagnosing Seasonal Failure',
       as_bars=True, # Use bars to highlight the cluster
       fill_gradient=False, # Turn off gradient to reduce clutter
       mask_angle=False, # Show the angular (day) labels
       verbose=0,
       savefig="gallery/images/gallery_coverage_diagnostic_seasonal.png"
   )


.. figure:: ../images/uncertainty/gallery_coverage_diagnostic_seasonal.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: A coverage diagnostic plot showing a clear cluster of failures.

   A diagnostic plot using bars, where a dense cluster of failures
   (bars at radius 0) is clearly visible in one sector of the plot.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot immediately reveals a critical, systematic failure in the
   model. While the overall coverage rate (solid red line) might still
   be reasonably high, there is a dense **cluster of failures** (bars at
   radius 0) concentrated in one specific angular sector. In this
   scenario, this corresponds to the summer months. This tells us the
   model's uncertainty estimates are not robust; they are systematically
   too narrow and unreliable during summer, even though they perform
   well for the rest of the year. This is a clear signal that the model
   needs to be improved to handle seasonal volatility.

.. _gallery_plot_interval_consistency: 

----------------------
Interval Consistency
----------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_interval_consistency`
function is an advanced diagnostic for assessing the **stability** of a
model's uncertainty estimates over time. While other plots show the
magnitude of uncertainty at a single point, this visualization answers
a deeper question: "Is my model's assessment of its own uncertainty
reliable and consistent from one forecast period to the next?"

Let's begin by understanding the components of this powerful plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents each individual **sample** or **location**,
     arranged sequentially around the circle by its DataFrame index.
     Since this ordering is often arbitrary, it is common to hide the
     angular tick labels using ``mask_angle=True``.
   * **Radius (r):** This is the key metric. It represents the
     **variability of the interval width** over multiple time steps for a
     single location. By default (``use_cv=True``), it is the
     **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**, which measures relative
     variability. Points far from the center have highly inconsistent
     uncertainty estimates.
   * **Color:** Provides context by representing the **average median
     (Q50) prediction** for each location across all time steps. This helps
     diagnose if inconsistency (high radius) is related to the
     magnitude of the prediction itself (color).

Now, let's apply this diagnostic to a real-world problem, starting with
a simple case and moving to a more complex one.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Identifying Inconsistent Forecasts**

The primary use of this plot is to identify locations where a model's
uncertainty estimates are unstable. A model that is very confident one
year and very uncertain the next for the same location may not be
trustworthy for long-term planning.

Let's simulate multi-year river flow forecasts for a set of monitoring
stations. Some stations will have stable uncertainty, while for others,
it will fluctuate wildly.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # --- 1. Data Generation: Stable and Unstable Stations ---

   n_stations = 150
   years = [2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025]
   df = pd.DataFrame({'station_id': range(n_stations)})
   qlow_cols, qup_cols, q50_cols = [], [], []

   # Create a mix of stable and unstable stations
   stable_mask = np.arange(n_stations) < 100

       # For unstable stations, width fluctuates randomly each year
       base_width = np.where(stable_mask, 10, 10 + np.random.uniform(-8, 8, n_stations))

       df[f'q10_y{year}'] = median - base_width / 2

   Most stations (points) are clustered near the center, indicating
   consistent uncertainty estimates, while a few outliers with large
   radii represent highly unstable forecasts.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot effectively separates the forecasts with stable uncertainty
   from those with more volatile uncertainty. A significant cluster of
   points is visible very close to the center, indicating a **low
   Coefficient of Variation (CV)**. For these stations, the model
   produces a stable and consistent prediction interval width year
   after year. The plot also reveals a second, more diffuse cloud of
   points at a larger radius, representing stations where the model's
   assessment of its own uncertainty is moderately inconsistent. The
   color, representing the average predicted flow, appears reddish for
   most points, suggesting that both stable and unstable uncertainty
   estimates occur primarily for high-flow stations in this dataset.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 2: Comparing Absolute vs. Relative Variability**

The choice between using the Coefficient of Variation (``use_cv=True``)
and the Standard Deviation (``use_cv=False``) for the radius is an
important one.

- **CV** measures *relative* inconsistency.
- **Standard Deviation** measures *absolute* inconsistency.

A station with a large average interval width might have a large
standard deviation but a small CV, meaning it's consistently uncertain.
Let's create a scenario to highlight this difference.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation: High vs. Low Flow Stations ---
   np.random.seed(1)
   n_stations = 100

   qlow_cols, qup_cols, q50_cols = [], [], []

   # Low-flow stations: small but relatively inconsistent widths
   low_flow_mask = np.arange(n_stations) < 50

       median = np.where(low_flow_mask, 10, 100)
       df_compare[f'q10_y{year}'] = median - width/2

   shows the low-flow stations are more inconsistent *relative* to their
   small average width.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This side-by-side comparison is extremely revealing. The **left
   plot**, using Standard Deviation, shows that the high-flow stations
   (yellow dots) have a much larger radius than the low-flow stations
   (purple dots). This tells us that in *absolute* terms, the interval
   width for high-flow stations fluctuates much more. However, the
   **right plot**, using the Coefficient of Variation, flips the story.
   Here, the low-flow stations (purple dots) are generally at a larger
   radius, meaning that *relative* to their small average width, their
   fluctuations are more significant and proportionally less predictable.

.. admonition:: Best Practice
   :class: best-practice

   When comparing the stability of forecasts across different regimes
   (e.g., high-flow vs. low-flow stations), always check the consistency
   using both absolute (``use_cv=False``) and relative
   (``use_cv=True``) variability. The best choice depends on your
   application: if any absolute change is costly, use standard
   deviation. If you care more about proportional predictability, use CV.

.. _gallery_plot_interval_width: 

--------------
Interval Width
--------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_interval_width` function is a
specialized diagnostic tool for visualizing the **magnitude of predicted
uncertainty**. It creates a polar scatter plot where the distance from the
center (radius) directly represents the width of a model's prediction
interval for each sample. It is an essential tool for understanding a
forecast's sharpness and identifying patterns in its confidence.

Before exploring its applications, let's first understand how to read
this unique plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents each individual **sample's position** in
     the dataset, arranged sequentially around the circle by its
     DataFrame index. Since the index order is often arbitrary, the
     angular labels are typically hidden via ``mask_angle=True`` to
     avoid confusion.
   * **Radius (r):** Directly corresponds to the **prediction interval
     width** (:math:`Q_{upper} - Q_{lower}`). A larger radius means the
     model is predicting a wider range of outcomes and is therefore
     more uncertain for that specific sample.
   * **Color:** Represents a third, contextual variable defined by the
     ``z_col`` parameter. This is usefull for diagnosing relationships,
     such as whether high uncertainty (large radius) correlates with
     high median predictions (e.g., bright colors).

With this framework, we can now apply the plot to a real-world problem,
starting with a basic analysis and progressing to more advanced use cases.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Basic Assessment of Uncertainty Spread**

The most direct application of this plot is to get an immediate visual
overview of the sharpness of a forecast. For a given set of
predictions, are the uncertainty intervals generally wide or narrow?
And is the uncertainty consistent across all samples?

Let's simulate a forecast for a process where the uncertainty is
expected to be relatively constant.

   does not change across samples.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot shows the interval width for 200 different samples. The key
   insight is that the points form a **thin, circular ring** at a nearly
   constant radius of approximately 15. This indicates that the model is
   **homoscedastic**—it predicts a consistent level of uncertainty for
   every sample in the dataset. The color, which in this case also
   represents the width, is uniform, reinforcing this finding. This is
   the expected behavior for many simple systems.

**Use Case 2: Correlating Uncertainty with Forecast Magnitude**

A more advanced use case is to investigate whether a
model's uncertainty is correlated with its own central prediction. A
robust model should often be more uncertain when it is predicting
extreme values. The ``z_col`` parameter is the key to unlocking this
insight.

Let's analyze a forecast for daily river flow, where we expect the
uncertainty to be much higher during high-flow (flood) events.

   A spiral of points where both the radius (uncertainty) and the

   showing a strong correlation.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot reveals a relationship in the forecast. The
   points form a spiral, not a simple ring. We can see that points with
   a small radius (low uncertainty) are dark purple, which the color
   bar tells us corresponds to a low median flow (``q50_flow``).
   Conversely, points with a large radius (high uncertainty) are bright
   yellow, corresponding to a high median flow. This is a clear visual
   confirmation of **heteroscedasticity**: the model has correctly
   learned to be more uncertain during high-flow periods and more
   confident during low-flow periods.

.. admonition:: Best Practice
   :class: best-practice

   When diagnosing heteroscedasticity, setting ``z_col`` to your
   median prediction column (e.g., 'q50') is a good technique. A
   strong correlation between the radius (width) and the color
   (median) is often a sign of a well-behaved model that correctly
   scales its uncertainty with the magnitude of the phenomenon it is
   predicting.

Model Drift
-------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_model_drift` function is a
specialized tool for diagnosing how a model's performance degrades
over longer prediction horizons. Using a polar bar chart, it visualizes
how average uncertainty—or another metric of your choice—evolves as the
forecast lead time increases, a phenomenon often called **model drift**.

First, let's break down the components of this diagnostic chart.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Each angular sector is assigned to a different
     **forecast horizon** (e.g., "1 Week Ahead", "2 Weeks Ahead"). This
     creates a clear, sequential progression around the plot.
   * **Radius (r):** Represents the **average value of the primary
     metric** for that horizon. By default, this is the mean prediction
     interval width (:math:`Q_{upper} - Q_{lower}`), a measure of
     uncertainty. A longer bar means higher average uncertainty.
   * **Color:** Provides a second dimension of information. By default,
     it also represents the primary metric (radius), but it can be
     mapped to a secondary metric (like average error) using the
     ``color_metric_cols`` parameter.

With this in mind, let's apply the plot to a practical supply chain
problem, starting with a basic uncertainty analysis and then adding a
layer of complexity.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Visualizing Uncertainty Drift**

The most common use for this plot is to visualize how forecast
sharpness degrades over time. A supply chain manager needs to
understand how quickly the uncertainty in their demand forecast grows
from one week to the next to manage inventory and mitigate the risk of
stock-outs.

This example will show the average prediction interval width for demand
forecasts at four different lead times.

   uncertainty grows as the forecast lead time increases.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot provides a clear and intuitive summary of model drift. The
   height (radius) of each bar represents the average uncertainty for
   that forecast horizon. We can see a distinct and progressive **increase
   in the bar heights** as we move from the "1-Week Ahead" to the "4-Weeks
   Ahead" forecast. The annotations quantify this, showing the average
   interval width growing from ~100 (100.44) to over 250 units (250.23). This is a classic
   demonstration of model drift, where the forecast becomes rapidly less
   precise at longer lead times, a critical insight for inventory planning.

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 2: Adding a Second Metric with Color**

While uncertainty is critical, it's only half the story. We also care
about accuracy. Does the model's error (e.g., Mean Absolute Error) also
increase at longer horizons? The ``color_metric_cols`` parameter allows
us to layer this second dimension of information onto our plot.

Let's simulate the MAE for each horizon and use it to color the bars,
giving us a simultaneous view of both uncertainty and accuracy drift.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation (assumes df from previous step is available) ---
   # Simulate Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for each horizon, which also increases

       # MAE increases with each horizon
       mae = 25 + 15 * i + np.random.uniform(-5, 5, n_samples)
       df[f'mae_h{i+1}'] = mae

   :alt: A polar bar chart showing drift, where color represents a second metric (MAE).

   A polar bar chart where bar height still shows uncertainty, but
   the color now represents the average forecast error (MAE), with
   darker red indicating higher error.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This enhanced plot now tells a richer story. As before, the
   **increasing height** of the bars shows that the forecast uncertainty
   is growing. In addition, the **color of the bars**—which now
   represents the average MAE—is getting progressively darker and redder.
   This confirms our hypothesis: as the forecast horizon extends, the
   model becomes not only less certain (wider intervals) but also less
   accurate (higher error). This two-dimensional diagnostic provides a
   more complete picture of performance degradation.

.. _gallery_plot_temporal_uncertainty:

----------------------
Temporal Uncertainty
----------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_temporal_uncertainty` function
is a flexible, general-purpose tool for visualizing and comparing
multiple data series in a polar context. While it can be used for many
tasks, its primary application is to display the full spread of a
probabilistic forecast at a single point in time by plotting several of
its predicted quantiles simultaneously.

Let's first break down the components of this versatile plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents each individual **sample's position** in
     the dataset, arranged sequentially around the circle by its
     DataFrame index. As this index order may not always be meaningful,
     it is often best practice to hide the angular labels by setting
     ``mask_angle=True``.
   * **Radius (r):** Corresponds to the **magnitude of the predicted
     value** for each specific quantile series. When ``normalize=False``,
     this shows the raw predicted values (e.g., stock price). When
     ``normalize=True``, it shows the relative position of the
     prediction within that series' own min-max range.
   * **Color:** Each data series (e.g., Q10, Q25, Q50) is assigned a
     distinct color from the chosen ``cmap``, making it easy to
     distinguish the different layers of the forecast.

With this in mind, let's explore how this plot can be used to analyze
a complex financial forecast.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Visualizing a Symmetric Forecast Distribution**

The most common use case is to visualize the shape and spread of a
forecast's uncertainty. A well-behaved, simple forecast might produce a
symmetrical uncertainty distribution around its median prediction.

Let's simulate a forecast for a stock's price over 100 days, where the
predicted uncertainty is stable and symmetric.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   n_days = 100
   base_price = 150 + np.cumsum(np.random.randn(n_days))
   df = pd.DataFrame()
   # Symmetrical quantiles around a median (Q50)
   df['q10'] = base_price - 15
   df['q25'] = base_price - 7
   df['q50'] = base_price

   Five concentric, parallel rings of points, representing a symmetric
   probabilistic forecast where the uncertainty spread is constant.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot visualizes the entire forecast distribution for each day. We
   see five distinct, roughly parallel spirals, each representing a
   quantile. The radial distance between the outermost (Q90) and
   innermost (Q10) spirals represents the width of the 80% prediction
   interval. The key insight here is that the spacing between the
   quantile spirals is **symmetrical and constant**. The distance from Q10
   to Q25 is the same as from Q75 to Q90, and the Q50 (median) is perfectly
   centered. This is the signature of a simple, symmetric uncertainty
   forecast.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 2: Diagnosing Skewed Uncertainty**

Real-world uncertainty is often not symmetric. For example, a stock's
price might have a much larger potential upside (risk of a price surge)
than a downside. This plot is an ideal tool for diagnosing such
**skewed** distributions.

Let's simulate a forecast for a volatile tech stock, where the model
predicts a greater chance of large positive returns than large negative ones.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation: Skewed Uncertainty ---

   df_skewed = pd.DataFrame()
   # Asymmetrical quantiles: larger gap on the upside
   df_skewed['q10'] = base_price - 5
   df_skewed['q25'] = base_price - 2
   df_skewed['q50'] = base_price
   df_skewed['q75'] = base_price + 8  # Larger step
   df_skewed['q90'] = base_price + 20 # Much larger step

   (Q10, Q25).

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   Unlike the first example, the spacing between the quantile spirals is
   now clearly **asymmetrical**. The radial distance between the upper
   quantiles (Q75 and Q90) is much larger than the distance between the
   lower quantiles (Q10 and Q25). This plot immediately reveals that
   the model is predicting a **positively skewed** distribution. It
   forecasts a limited downside risk but a much larger potential for
   significant positive price movements, an important insight for any
   trading or investment strategy.

-------------------
Uncertainty Drift
-------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_uncertainty_drift` function
is a tool for visualizing how an entire **spatial pattern** of
uncertainty evolves over multiple time steps. Unlike plots that show an
average drift, this visualization uses concentric rings to display a
complete "map" of uncertainty for each forecast period, allowing you to
diagnose complex spatiotemporal changes.

Let's begin by understanding the components of this innovative plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents each individual **sample** or **location**
     in the dataset, arranged sequentially around the circle. For
     geospatial data, this could correspond to longitude or a station
     index. Since the raw index may not be meaningful, it's common to
     hide the angular tick labels with ``mask_angle=True``.
   * **Concentric Rings:** Each colored ring corresponds to a different
     **time step** or forecast horizon (e.g., Year 1, Year 2). Later
     time steps are plotted on outer rings.
   * **Radius (r) of a Ring:** The radius of the line on any given ring
     is a combination of a base offset (to separate the rings) and a
     component proportional to the **globally normalized interval
     width**. Therefore, "bumps" or outward bulges in a ring signify
     regions of higher relative uncertainty at that time step.

Now, let's apply this plot to a critical environmental forecasting
problem.

**Use Case 1: Identifying Uniform Uncertainty Growth**

In the simplest scenario, a model's uncertainty might be expected to
grow uniformly over time and across all locations. This plot can
validate that assumption.

Let's simulate a multi-year land subsidence forecast for a region where
we expect the uncertainty to increase at the same rate everywhere.

   A series of perfectly circular and evenly spaced concentric rings,

   uniformly over time and space.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot shows four perfectly circular rings, one for each year.
   The key insights are twofold. First, the **radius of the rings
   steadily increases** from 2024 (innermost) to 2027 (outermost),
   confirming that the average forecast uncertainty is growing over time.
   Second, each ring is a **perfect circle**, which means that for any
   given year, the predicted uncertainty is the same for all locations.
   This is the signature of a simple, uniform uncertainty drift.

**Use Case 2: Diagnosing Spatiotemporal Drift**

More realistically, a model's uncertainty drift is not uniform.
Certain regions may become unpredictable much faster than others. This
plot excels at revealing these complex, combined spatial and temporal
patterns.

Let's simulate a more realistic scenario where subsidence uncertainty
grows much faster in a specific, localized region.

   :class: hint

   This plot immediately reveals a complex spatiotemporal pattern. While
   all the rings grow larger from 2024 to 2027, indicating a general
   increase in uncertainty over time, they are no longer perfect
   circles. A significant **"bulge"** has developed in the top-left
   quadrant (from 90° to 180°). This bulge becomes progressively more
   pronounced in the outer rings (later years). This is a perfect
   insight: it tells us that not only is uncertainty growing, but it is
   growing **much faster** in this specific geographic region, which
   should be the highest priority for monitoring.

Prediction Velocity
---------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_velocity` function moves
beyond static predictions to visualize the **dynamics of change**. It
calculates the average rate of change (or "velocity") of a forecast's
central tendency over time for multiple locations. This is essential
for identifying "hotspots" where a phenomenon is changing most rapidly
and for understanding the underlying trends in a system.

First, let's explore the components of this dynamic visualization.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents each individual **sample** or **location**,
     arranged sequentially around the circle by its DataFrame index.
     Since this ordering is often arbitrary, the angular labels can be
     hidden with ``mask_angle=True`` to focus on the radial patterns.
   * **Radius (r):** Corresponds to the **average velocity** of the
     median (Q50) prediction over the specified time steps. A larger
     radius signifies a faster average rate of change for that
     location. The radius can be normalized or shown in its raw units.
   * **Color:** Provides a crucial second layer of context. It can either
     represent the **average absolute magnitude** of the prediction
     (``use_abs_color=True``) or the **velocity itself**
     (``use_abs_color=False``), which is usefull for showing the
     direction of change.

With this framework, let's apply the plot to a critical environmental
monitoring problem.

**Use Case 1: Identifying Hotspots of Change**

The most direct use of this plot is to identify which locations are
changing the fastest. We can visualize the rate of change (velocity) as
the radius and use color to provide context about the absolute state of
each location.

Let's simulate a multi-year forecast of land subsidence (sinking) for
various locations in a coastal city. The primary goal is to find the
areas that are sinking most rapidly.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # --- 1. Data Generation: Land Subsidence Forecast ---
   np.random.seed(42)
   n_locations = 150
   df = pd.DataFrame({'location_id': range(n_locations)})
   years = [2024, 2025, 2026, 2027]
   q50_cols = []
   # Assign a base subsidence level and a variable velocity to each location
   base_subsidence = np.random.uniform(5, 20, n_locations)
   velocity = np.linspace(0.5, 5, n_locations) # Some sink slow, some fast
   np.random.shuffle(velocity) # Randomize the velocities

   for i, year in enumerate(years):
       q50_col = f'subsidence_{year}_q50'
       q50_cols.append(q50_col)
       df[q50_col] = base_subsidence + velocity * i

   # --- 2. Plotting ---
   kd.plot_velocity(
       df=df,

       normalize=True,     # Normalize velocity for a clear [0,1] radius
       cmap='plasma',
       cbar=True,

   :alt: A polar scatter plot where radius shows velocity and color shows magnitude.

   Points spiraling outwards, where the distance from the center (radius)
   indicates the normalized rate of sinking, and the color indicates
   the average total subsidence.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot effectively identifies hotspots of change. The **radius** of
   each point represents its normalized velocity, so points at the
   outer edge of the spiral are the locations predicted to sink the
   fastest. The **color**, representing the average total subsidence, adds
   critical context. The spiral transitions from dark purple (low total
   subsidence) to bright yellow (high total subsidence). The key insight
   is the strong correlation: the locations sinking the fastest (large
   radius) are also the ones with the highest overall subsidence (bright
   yellow). This tells planners that the most critical areas are
   continuing to degrade at the highest rates.

**Use Case 2: Distinguishing Direction of Change**

Beyond just the speed of change, we often need to know the *direction*.
Is a value increasing or decreasing? By setting ``use_abs_color=False``
and using a diverging colormap, we can use color to represent the
direction and magnitude of the velocity itself.

Let's analyze a forecast of glacier mass balance (the net gain or loss
of ice) for different glaciers. Some are predicted to grow (positive
velocity), while most are predicted to shrink (negative velocity).

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation: Glacier Mass Balance ---
   np.random.seed(1)
   n_glaciers = 100
   df_glaciers = pd.DataFrame({'glacier_id': range(n_glaciers)})
   years = [2025, 2030, 2035, 2040]
   q50_cols = []
   # Most glaciers are shrinking (negative velocity)
   base_mass = np.random.uniform(100, 500, n_glaciers)
   velocity = np.random.normal(-10, 3, n_glaciers)
   # A few are stable or growing
   velocity[np.random.choice(n_glaciers, 10, replace=False)] *= -0.5

   for i, year in enumerate(years):
       q50_col = f'mass_{year}_q50'
       q50_cols.append(q50_col)
       df_glaciers[q50_col] = base_mass + velocity * i

   # --- 2. Plotting with color representing velocity direction ---
   kd.plot_velocity(
       df=df_glaciers,
       q50_cols=q50_cols,
       title='Use Case 2: Glacier Mass Balance Velocity',
       use_abs_color=False, # Color by velocity itself
       normalize=False,     # Use raw velocity for the radius
       cmap='coolwarm',     # A diverging colormap (blue-white-red)
       cbar=True,
       savefig="gallery/images/gallery_velocity_directional.png"
   )

.. figure:: ../images/uncertainty/gallery_velocity_directional.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: A polar plot where color distinguishes between positive and negative velocity.

   Points colored with a diverging colormap. The blue points show a
   negative velocity (shrinking), while the few red points show a
   positive velocity (growing).

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot now clearly distinguishes the direction of change. By using
   a diverging colormap like ``coolwarm``, the **color** directly tells
   us the sign of the velocity. The vast majority of points are blue,
   indicating a negative velocity—these are the glaciers predicted to
   lose mass (<0). The few red points represent the rare glaciers predicted
   to grow (>=0). The **radius** still represents the magnitude of this
   change, so the blue points furthest from the center are the glaciers
   predicted to be shrinking the fastest.

.. admonition:: Best Practice
   :class: best-practice

   When your data's rate of change can be both positive and negative,
   set ``use_abs_color=False`` and choose a diverging ``cmap`` (like
   ``coolwarm``, ``RdBu``, or ``seismic``). This is the most effective
   way to visually separate trends of increase versus decrease.

---------------------
Radial Density Ring
---------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_radial_density_ring` function
offers a unique and interesting way to visualize the shape of a
one-dimensional probability distribution. It transforms a standard
histogram or density plot into a smooth, continuous polar ring, where
the color intensity reveals the most common values. This is an
invaluable tool for understanding the fundamental character of your data,
be it forecast errors, interval widths, or any other continuous metric.

Let's begin by understanding the components of this elegant visualization.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** The angular dimension **carries no information** in
     this plot. The density is repeated around the full circle purely for
     aesthetic effect, creating the "ring" shape. The angular labels are
     therefore hidden by default.
   * **Radius (r):** Directly corresponds to the **value of the variable**
     being analyzed (e.g., forecast error, interval width). The radial
     axis represents the domain of your data.
   * **Color:** Represents the **normalized probability density** at each
     radial position, calculated via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
     Bright, intense colors indicate the most common values (the peaks, or
     modes, of the distribution).

This function can derive the data to be plotted in three different ways
using the ``kind`` parameter. Let's explore each one with a practical
example.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Distribution of a Direct Metric (``kind='direct'``)**

The most straightforward use of this plot is to visualize the
distribution of any single, pre-existing column in your data. A classic
application is to examine the distribution of model errors (residuals)
to check for bias.

An unbiased model should have errors centered symmetrically around zero.
Let's check if our simulated model meets this crucial criterion.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # --- 1. Data Generation (shared for all examples) ---
   np.random.seed(42)
   n_samples = 1000
   df_test = pd.DataFrame({
       'q10': np.random.normal(10, 2, n_samples),
       'q90': np.random.normal(30, 3, n_samples),
       'value_2022': np.random.gamma(3, 5, n_samples),
       'value_2023': np.random.gamma(4, 5, n_samples),
       'error_metric': np.random.normal(loc=2.5, scale=5, size=n_samples) # A biased error
   })
   # Ensure q90 is always greater than q10
   df_test['q90'] = df_test[['q10', 'q90']].max(axis=1) + np.random.rand(n_samples) * 2

   :alt: A radial density ring for a direct metric, showing a biased distribution.

   A density ring where the brightest color is not at the center (radius 0),
   indicating a biased error distribution.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot visualizes the distribution of our model's errors. For an
   unbiased model, the brightest part of the ring should be centered
   perfectly at a **radius of 0**. Here, however, the bright yellow ring
   is clearly centered at a positive radius of approximately +2.5. This
   instantly reveals a **systemic positive bias** in the forecast; the
   model, on average, under-predicts the true value by 2.5 units. The
   symmetric, bell-like shape of the ring suggests the errors are otherwise
   normally distributed, but their center is in the wrong place.

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 2: Distribution of Interval Width (``kind='width'``)**

A crucial aspect of a probabilistic forecast is its sharpness, which is
measured by the prediction interval width. This plot can help us
understand the characteristics of our model's uncertainty estimates. Are
they consistent, or do they vary wildly?

Let's visualize the distribution of the interval width calculated from
our simulated forecast's 10th and 90th percentiles.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation (uses df_test from previous step) ---

   :alt: A radial density ring for interval width.

   A density ring showing that the most common interval width is
   approximately 22 units.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot reveals the distribution of the model's predicted
   uncertainty. The brightest part of the ring is centered around a
   **radius of approximately 22**. This tells us that the most common
   prediction interval width produced by the model is 22 units. The
   distribution is fairly symmetric and tight, suggesting the model
   produces a relatively consistent level of uncertainty for most
   samples. A very wide or multi-peaked ring would indicate more erratic
   uncertainty estimation.

**Use Case 3: Distribution of Change (``kind='velocity'``)**

This mode is perfect for analyzing the distribution of change between
two time points or a "velocity." This is invaluable for understanding
the dynamics of a system. Is change typically small and centered around
zero, or are large shifts common?

Let's analyze the year-over-year change in our simulated gamma-distributed
values from 2022 to 2023.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation (uses df_test from previous step) ---

   # --- 2. Plotting ---
   kd.plot_radial_density_ring(
       df=df_test,
       kind="velocity",
       target_cols=["value_2022", "value_2023"],
       title="Use Case 3: Distribution of Year-over-Year Change",
       cmap="inferno",

   :width: 70%
   :alt: A radial density ring showing the distribution of change.

   A density ring showing that the most common year-over-year change
   was a positive increase of about 5 units.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot shows the distribution of the year-over-year change in our
   variable. The brightest part of the ring is centered at a **positive
   radius of about +5**. This indicates that the most common change
   from 2022 to 2023 was an **increase of 5 units**. The distribution is
   also positively skewed, with a "tail" of brighter color extending
   to larger positive radii. This suggests that while a +5 change was
   most typical, some samples experienced a much larger positive
   increase, while large decreases were rare.

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 4: Comparing Conditional Distributions**

A truly usefull application of this plot is to move beyond analyzing a
single dataset and instead compare the distributions of a metric under
two different conditions. By creating a side-by-side plot, we can
visually diagnose how the fundamental shape of a distribution changes
in response to different circumstances, a common task in A/B testing or
conditional analysis.

.. admonition:: Best Practice
   :class: best-practice

   While ``plot_radial_density_ring`` is designed to create a single
   plot, you can easily combine multiple plots into a single figure for
   comparison by first creating your own Matplotlib figure and axes, and
   then passing the individual ``ax`` objects to the function.

Let's investigate a critical business problem for a logistics company:
quantifying the impact of adverse weather on package delivery times.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   A logistics company needs to set realistic delivery expectations for
   its customers. They know that storms cause delays, but they need to
   quantify this impact precisely. The goal is to compare the
   distribution of delivery times on "Clear Days" versus "Stormy Days".
   This will help them understand not only the average delay caused by
   storms but also how much more *unpredictable* the delivery times become.

   We will create two radial density rings and display them side-by-side
   for a direct visual comparison of the two weather conditions.

   .. code-block:: python
      :linenos:

      # --- 1. Data Generation: Delivery Times under Two Conditions ---
      np.random.seed(1)
      n_clear = 1000
      n_stormy = 500
      # On clear days, delivery times are predictable
      clear_days_delivery_time = np.random.normal(loc=3, scale=0.5, size=n_clear)
      # On stormy days, deliveries are delayed and more variable
      stormy_days_delivery_time = np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=1.5, size=n_stormy)

      df_clear = pd.DataFrame({'delivery_time_days': clear_days_delivery_time})
      df_stormy = pd.DataFrame({'delivery_time_days': stormy_days_delivery_time})

   The right plot (Stormy Days) shows a wider, more diffuse ring at a
   higher radius.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   The side-by-side comparison makes the impact of adverse weather
   unmistakable. The plot for **Clear Days** (left) shows a single,
   bright, and narrow green ring centered at a radius of **3 days**. This
   indicates that on clear days, deliveries are highly predictable and
   consistent. In stark contrast, the plot for **Stormy Days** (right)
   shows a red ring that is centered at a much higher radius of **5
   days** and is significantly wider and more diffuse. This provides
   two critical insights: storms not only cause an average delay of
   two days, but they also dramatically increase the
   **unpredictability** (variance) of delivery times.

Polar Heatmap
---------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_polar_heatmap` is a 
tool for discovering "hot spots" and complex patterns in your data. It
creates a 2D density plot on a polar grid, showing the concentration
of data points based on two variables. It is especially effective for
visualizing the interaction between a cyclical feature (like time of
day) and a linear magnitude.

First, let's break down how to read this intuitive map of your data's
density.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents the value of the ``theta_col``. This is
     typically a **cyclical feature**, like the hour of the day or
     month of the year. The plot wraps around seamlessly when a
     ``theta_period`` is provided.
   * **Radius (r):** Represents the value of the ``r_col``. This is
     typically a **linear magnitude**, like rainfall amount or error
     size, with lower values near the center and higher values at the
     edge.
   * **Color:** Represents the **density of data points** (the
     ``statistic``, which is 'count' by default) within each polar
     bin. Bright, intense "hot" colors indicate a high concentration
     of data points in that specific angle-radius region.

With this in mind, let's explore how to use this plot to find patterns
in different real-world datasets.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Identifying Temporal Hot Spots**

The most common use for a polar heatmap is to find out *when* and at
*what magnitude* events of interest are most likely to occur.

Let's imagine a city's public safety department wants to visualize the
density of emergency calls. They need to know not only the busiest
times of day, but also the typical number of calls during those peak
times to ensure proper staffing.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation

   This plot transforms a raw data table into an intuitive "hot spot"
   map. The angle represents the hour of the day (with midnight at the
   right, 0°, and noon at the left, 180°), while the radius represents
   the volume of calls. The bright yellow and white colors reveal a
   clear **hot spot of activity**. This peak concentration occurs in the
   **late evening hours** (roughly 18:00 to 22:00) and for incidents with a
   **low-to-moderate call volume** (a radius between 2 and 10). This
   provides a direct, data-driven insight for resource allocation.

**Use Case 2: Visualizing Model Error Interactions**

A more advanced, diagnostic use case is to visualize the interaction
between a model's features and its prediction errors. This can help
uncover conditional biases that are not visible in simple error plots.

Let's analyze a temperature forecasting model. We hypothesize that the
model's prediction error is not random, but instead depends on both the
**time of day** and the **true temperature** itself. Perhaps the model
only makes large errors on hot afternoons.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This diagnostic plot instantly confirms our hypothesis. The angle
   represents the hour of the day, while the radius represents the
   magnitude of the forecast error. The bright yellow hot spot is
   located in the angular sector corresponding to the **afternoon hours**
   (13:00-18:00) and at a **large radius**, indicating a high
   concentration of large errors. The rest of the plot is dark, meaning
   large errors are rare at other times of the day. This is a clear
   sign of a conditional bias: the model is reliable most of the time
   but systematically fails on hot afternoons.

   This plot is closely related to the
   :func:`~kdiagram.plot.feature_based.plot_feature_interaction`
   function. While this heatmap visualizes the **density (count)** of
   data points, ``plot_feature_interaction`` visualizes the **average
   value of a third variable**. Use this plot to find *where your data is*,
   and use ``plot_feature_interaction`` to find *what the average outcome is*
   in those locations.

Polar Quiver Plot
-------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_polar_quiver` function is a
unique tool for visualizing **vector fields** in a polar context. Some
phenomena are not just about static values, but about **change**,
**flow**, or **error**, which have both magnitude and direction. This
plot represents each data point not as a dot, but as an arrow, making
it ideal for bringing these dynamic processes to life.

Let's begin by dissecting the components of this vector visualization.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Arrow Position (Origin):** The base (tail) of each arrow is
     positioned at a specific polar coordinate :math:`(r, \theta)`
     determined by the ``r_col`` and ``theta_col`` values.
   * **Arrow Direction & Length:** The arrow's orientation and length
     are determined by its vector components. The ``u_col`` defines the
     radial component (change along the radius), and the ``v_col``
     defines the tangential component (change along the azimuth).
   * **Color:** The color of each arrow provides an additional layer of
     information. By default, it represents the **total magnitude** of
     the vector, but it can be mapped to any other variable using the
     ``color_col`` parameter.

With this in mind, let's explore how this plot can be used to analyze
different kinds of dynamic data.

**Use Case 1: Visualizing Forecast Revisions**

A common task in operational forecasting is to track how predictions for
a specific future event change over time as new information becomes
available. A quiver plot is an excellent tool for visualizing these
revisions.

Let's simulate a scenario where we have an initial forecast for a value
at different locations, and then a subsequent update. The quiver plot will
show us the direction and magnitude of the change between the two forecasts.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # --- 1. Data Generation: Forecast Revisions ---
   np.random.seed(0)
   n_points = 50
   locations = np.linspace(0, 360, n_points, endpoint=False)
   # An initial forecast with some spatial pattern
   initial_forecast = 10 + 5 * np.sin(np.deg2rad(locations) * 3)
   # Simulate revisions (the "update" vector)
   radial_change = np.random.normal(0, 1.5, n_points)
   tangential_change = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, n_points)

   df_forecasts = pd.DataFrame({
       'location_angle': locations,
       'initial_value': initial_forecast,
       'update_radial': radial_change,
       'update_tangential': tangential_change,
   })

   # --- 2. Plotting ---
   kd.plot_polar_quiver(
       df=df_forecasts,
       r_col='initial_value',
       theta_col='location_angle',

       v_col='update_tangential',
       theta_period=360,

   Arrows originating from an initial forecast value, showing the
   direction and magnitude of the update.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot visualizes the stability of a forecast. Each arrow's base
   sits on the initial forecast value for a specific location (angle).
   The arrow itself represents the revision. An arrow pointing outward
   (a positive radial component) means the forecast was revised upward,
   while an inward-pointing arrow means it was revised downward. In this
   example, the revisions appear random and small, with no systematic
   pattern, suggesting the forecast is relatively stable between
   updates. A plot with all arrows pointing outward would indicate a
   systematic upward revision bias.

**Use Case 2: Mapping a 2D Error Vector Field**

Another interesting application is to visualize a model's error not as a
single number, but as a two-dimensional vector. This is common in
spatial forecasting, where an error has both a distance component and a
directional component.

Imagine a model that predicts the landing location of a weather balloon.
The error for each prediction can be described by how many kilometers it
was off (radial error) and by which direction it missed (tangential
error).

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation: 2D Spatial Errors ---
   np.random.seed(42)
   n_landings = 60
   # The true landing locations
   true_r = np.random.uniform(20, 80, n_landings)
   true_theta_deg = np.linspace(0, 360, n_landings, endpoint=False)
   # Simulate a model that has a systematic drift (e.g., always misses to the "north-east")
   radial_error = np.random.normal(2, 2, n_landings)
   tangential_error = np.random.normal(5, 2, n_landings)

   df_landings = pd.DataFrame({
       'true_dist_km': true_r,
       'true_angle_deg': true_theta_deg,
       'error_radial_km': radial_error,
       'error_tangential_km': tangential_error
   })

   # --- 2. Plotting the Error Field ---
   kd.plot_polar_quiver(
       df=df_landings,
       r_col='true_dist_km',
       theta_col='true_angle_deg',
       u_col='error_radial_km',
       v_col='error_tangential_km',
       theta_period=360,
       title='Use Case 2: Weather Balloon Landing Error Field',
       cmap='viridis',
       scale=150
   )

.. figure:: ../images/uncertainty/gallery_polar_quiver_errors.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: A polar quiver plot where arrows represent 2D error vectors.

   Arrows originating from the true locations, all pointing in a
   similar direction, revealing a systematic error in the forecast.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   In this plot, the base of each arrow is the **true landing location**.
   The arrow itself is the **error vector**—it points from the true
   location to the predicted location. A perfect model would have zero-
   length arrows. Here, we see a clear and problematic pattern: nearly
   all the arrows point in the same general direction (counter-clockwise
   and slightly outwards). This reveals a **systematic drift** in the
   model. It consistently predicts that the balloons will land further
   out and further counter-clockwise than they actually do. This is a
   usefull diagnostic that would be difficult to see without a vector plot.

**Use Case 3: Comparing Dynamic States with Subplots**

One of the most applications of a quiver plot is to compare
two different vector fields side-by-side to understand how a dynamic
system changes over time or under different conditions. By creating a
figure with multiple subplots and passing the individual axes (`ax`) to
the function, we can create a direct and compelling comparative
visualization.

.. admonition:: Best Practice
   :class: best-practice

   For comparative analysis of vector fields, creating a multi-panel
   figure with ``matplotlib.pyplot.subplots`` and then passing each
   ``ax`` object to ``plot_polar_quiver`` is the recommended workflow.
   This gives you full control over the layout and allows for direct,
   side-by-side comparisons.

Let's tackle a classic oceanography problem: comparing ocean current
patterns between summer and winter.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   An oceanographer is studying a regional sea to understand how its
   circulation patterns change with the seasons. They have collected
   current velocity data from a network of buoys during both the
   summer and the winter. They need to visualize and compare these two
   vector fields to identify seasonal shifts in the direction and speed
   of the primary currents.

   We will create a side-by-side quiver plot. The left panel will show
   the strong summer currents, and the right panel will show the weaker,
   more complex winter currents, allowing for an immediate visual
   assessment of the seasonal change.

   .. code-block:: python
      :linenos:

      # --- 1. Data Generation: Seasonal Ocean Currents ---
      np.random.seed(1)
      n_buoys = 75
      # Buoy positions are the same for both seasons
      r_pos = np.random.uniform(10, 50, n_buoys)
      theta_pos_deg = np.linspace(0, 360, n_buoys, endpoint=False)

      # Summer: Strong, consistent counter-clockwise gyre
      u_summer = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, n_buoys)
      v_summer = 2.0 + np.sin(np.deg2rad(theta_pos_deg)) * 0.5
      df_summer = pd.DataFrame({
          'dist_km': r_pos, 'angle_deg': theta_pos_deg,
          'u_rad': u_summer, 'v_tan': v_summer
      })

      # Winter: Weaker, less consistent flow
      u_winter = np.random.normal(0, 0.2, n_buoys)
      v_winter = 0.8 - np.sin(np.deg2rad(theta_pos_deg)) * 0.5 # Weaker, different pattern
      df_winter = pd.DataFrame({
          'dist_km': r_pos, 'angle_deg': theta_pos_deg,
          'u_rad': u_winter, 'v_tan': v_winter
      })

      # --- 2. Create a figure with two polar subplots ---
      fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(18, 9),
                                   subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})

      # --- 3. Plot each season on its dedicated axis ---
      kd.plot_polar_quiver(
          df=df_summer, ax=ax1, r_col='dist_km', theta_col='angle_deg',
          u_col='u_rad', v_col='v_tan', theta_period=360,
          title='Summer Current Field', cmap='plasma', scale=40
      )

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   The side-by-side comparison immediately highlights the dramatic
   seasonal shift in ocean circulation. The **Summer** plot (left)
   displays a strong, coherent, counter-clockwise gyre, with the bright
   yellow and orange arrows indicating high-velocity currents
   throughout the northern half of the region. In stark contrast, the
   **Winter** plot (right) shows a much weaker and less organized
   system. The arrows are predominantly dark purple and blue, indicating
   a significant drop in current speed, and the cohesive rotational
   pattern has partially broken down. This comparative view provides an
   intuitive summary of the system's seasonal dynamics.
