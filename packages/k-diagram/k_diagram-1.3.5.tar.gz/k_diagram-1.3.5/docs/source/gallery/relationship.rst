Relationship Visualization
===========================

This gallery page showcases plots from the ``relationship`` module,
which provide unique polar perspectives on the relationships between
the core components of a forecast: **true values**, **model
predictions**, and **forecast errors**.

These diagnostic plots are designed to reveal complex patterns such as
conditional biases, heteroscedasticity, and non-linear correlations
that are often difficult to see in standard Cartesian plots. This
module is expected to expand with more specialized relationship
diagnostics in the future.

.. note::
   You need to run the code snippets locally to generate the plot
   images referenced below. Ensure the image paths in the
   ``.. image::`` directives match where you save the plots.

True vs. Predicted Relationship
---------------------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.relationship.plot_relationship` function offers
a novel way to visualize the correlation between true values and model
predictions, moving beyond a standard Cartesian scatter plot. By mapping
the true values to the angular axis and the normalized predicted values
to the radial axis, it creates a spiral-like plot that reveals the
consistency and correlation of model predictions across the entire data
range.

First, let's break down the components of this powerful comparative plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** The angular position is directly proportional to the
     **true value** (``y_true``) when using the default ``theta_scale=
     'proportional'``. The plot spirals outwards as the true value
     increases, mapping the full range of true values onto the chosen
     angular coverage.
   * **Radius (r):** The radial distance corresponds to the
     **normalized predicted value**. Each prediction series is scaled
     independently to the range [0, 1]. A radius of 1 means the
     prediction was the maximum value for *that specific model*, while a
     radius of 0 was its minimum.
   * **Color:** Each prediction series (``y_preds``) is assigned a
     distinct color, allowing for the direct comparison of multiple
     models on the same plot.

With this framework, let's apply the plot to a real-world problem,
progressing from a basic model comparison to a more advanced diagnostic.

**Use Case 1: Comparing Linear vs. Non-Linear Model Behavior**

The most direct use of this plot is to compare the fundamental response
patterns of different models. Does a model's prediction increase
linearly with the true value, or does it exhibit more complex,
non-linear behavior?

Let's simulate a scenario where an environmental agency is comparing a
simple linear model and a more complex non-linear model for predicting
river temperature.

   n_points = 150
   y_true = np.linspace(5, 25, n_points) # True water temperatures
   # Model A: A simple linear response
   y_pred_A = y_true + np.random.normal(0, 1.5, n_points)
   # Model B: A non-linear model that levels off at high temperatures
   y_pred_B = 25 - 20 * np.exp(-0.2 * y_true) + np.random.normal(0, 1.5, n_points)

   tight and uniform, while the orange spiral (Non-Linear Model) is
   more dispersed and shows a different shape.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot effectively contrasts the core behavior of the two models.
   **Model A (blue)** produces points that form a tight, consistent
   spiral. This visually confirms that its normalized predictions
   increase in a stable, linear fashion as the true temperature
   (angle) increases. In contrast, the points for **Model B (orange)**
   form a different pattern. Its spiral expands quickly at lower angles
   but then appears to compress at higher angles, visually revealing its
   non-linear response where predictions start to level off even as the
   true temperature continues to rise.

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 2: Using Custom Angular Labels for Better Context**

While mapping the angle to the true value is the default, the true value
itself might not be the most intuitive label for the angular axis. For
time series data, we often want to label the angle with the date or month.
The ``z_values`` and ``z_label`` parameters are designed for exactly this.

Let's analyze a 12-month forecast for a company's monthly recurring
revenue (MRR). We will map the true MRR to the angle for positioning, but
we will *label* the angle with the month to make the plot easier to read.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation: Monthly Revenue Forecast ---
   np.random.seed(42)
   n_months = 12 * 5 # 5 years of monthly data
   time_index = np.arange(n_months)
   # A signal with growth and yearly seasonality
   y_true_mrr = 100 + time_index * 2 + 20 * np.sin(time_index * 2 * np.pi / 12) + np.random.normal(0, 5, n_months)
   y_pred_mrr = y_true_mrr + np.random.normal(0, 8, n_months)
   # Our custom labels for the angular axis
   month_labels = (time_index % 12) + 1

   # --- 2. Plotting with Custom z_values ---

       y_true_mrr,
       y_pred_mrr,

       acov="default",
       z_values=month_labels, # Provide the month numbers as labels
       z_label="Month of Year",

   :alt: A polar scatter plot with custom angular tick labels for the month.

   A spiral of points where the angular ticks are labeled with the
   month of the year (1-12) instead of the raw true value.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot is now much more interpretable for a time series analysis.
   Although the points are still positioned angularly based on the true
   MRR value, the **angular tick labels now clearly show the month of
   the year**. The `z_label` adds a title to these custom ticks. This
   allows us to diagnose seasonal patterns. For example, we could now
   easily see if the model's performance (the tightness of the spiral) is
   worse during specific months, such as the end-of-year holiday season.

.. admonition:: Best Practice
   :class: best-practice

   For time series or other sequentially ordered data, using ``z_values``
   to label the angular axis with a time-based unit (like month, day, or
   hour) can make the plot vastly more intuitive and easier to interpret,
   providing richer context than the raw true values alone.

.. _gallery_plot_conditional_quantiles:

--------------------------
Conditional Quantile Bands
--------------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.relationship.plot_conditional_quantiles`
function is a diagnostic for visualizing the **conditional
behavior** of a probabilistic forecast. It answers the question: "How
does my model's entire predicted distribution, including its central
tendency and uncertainty, change as a function of the true observed
value?" It is the primary tool for visually diagnosing
**heteroscedasticity**.

First, let's break down the components of this detailed diagnostic plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents the **true observed value**
     (:math:`y_{true}`), sorted and mapped to the angular axis. The plot
     spirals outwards from the lowest true value to the highest.
   * **Radius (r):** Represents the **magnitude of the predicted value**
     for each quantile.
   * **Central Line:** The solid black line shows the **median (Q50)
     forecast**. Its spiral should ideally track the true value spiral (if
     it were plotted).
   * **Shaded Bands:** Each shaded band represents a **prediction
     interval** (e.g., the 80% interval between Q10 and Q90). The
     **width** of these bands at any given angle visualizes the model's
     predicted uncertainty for that specific true value.

Now, let's apply this plot to a real-world problem where understanding
conditional uncertainty is critical.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Diagnosing Heteroscedasticity in Financial Forecasting**

A core challenge in financial modeling is that volatility is not
constant. A stock's price may be stable and predictable during calm
periods but highly volatile and uncertain during market turmoil. A good
probabilistic model must capture this changing uncertainty.

Let's simulate a forecast for an asset's price, where the true volatility
(and thus the model's predictive uncertainty) increases as the asset's
price increases.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # --- 1. Data Generation: A forecast with heteroscedastic uncertainty ---
   np.random.seed(0)
   n_samples = 300
   # True asset price, sorted to create a smooth spiral
   y_true = np.linspace(50, 500, n_samples)
   quantiles = np.array([0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9]) # For 80% and 50% intervals

   # Key: Uncertainty (interval width) increases with the true value
   error_std = 5 + (y_true / 500) * 40
   # Generate quantile predictions based on this changing standard deviation
   y_preds = np.zeros((n_samples, len(quantiles)))
   y_preds[:, 2] = y_true + np.random.normal(0, 5, n_samples) # Median forecast
   z_scores = np.array([-1.28, -0.67, 0, 0.67, 1.28]) # For 10,25,50,75,90
   for i, z in enumerate(z_scores):
       y_preds[:, i] = y_preds[:, 2] + z * error_std

   :alt: A polar plot with quantile bands that get wider as they spiral outwards.

   A spiral of quantile bands where the width of the bands clearly
   increases as the radius and angle increase, showing heteroscedasticity.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot provides a clear and unambiguous diagnosis of the forecast's
   uncertainty structure. The most important feature is the **width of
   the shaded prediction intervals**. The bands are very narrow at small
   angles (corresponding to low true asset prices) and become
   progressively **wider** as the spiral moves outwards towards higher
   true values. This is the classic visual signature of
   **heteroscedasticity**. It demonstrates that the model has correctly
   learned to be more uncertain (predicting a wider range of outcomes)
   when forecasting high asset prices, which are typically more
   volatile.

**Use Case 2: Identifying a Homoscedastic (Naive) Model**

To better appreciate a good heteroscedastic model, it's useful to see
what a naive, **homoscedastic** model looks like. This type of model
incorrectly assumes that the level of uncertainty is constant, regardless
of the situation.

Let's create a forecast from a simpler model that uses a "one-size-fits-all"
approach to uncertainty for the same financial asset.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # --- 1. Data Generation (uses y_true and quantiles from previous step) ---
   # This model uses a constant, average uncertainty for all predictions
   constant_error_std = 20.0
   y_preds_homo = np.zeros((n_samples, len(quantiles)))
   y_preds_homo[:, 2] = y_true + np.random.normal(0, 5, n_samples)
   for i, z in enumerate(z_scores):
       y_preds_homo[:, i] = y_preds_homo[:, 2] + z * constant_error_std

   :alt: A polar plot with quantile bands that have a constant width.

   A spiral of quantile bands where the width of the shaded area remains
   constant from the center to the edge.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot shows a fundamentally different and more problematic
   behavior. The shaded bands now have a **constant width** as they spiral
   outwards. This demonstrates that the model is **homoscedastic**; it
   predicts the same level of uncertainty regardless of whether the true
   asset price is low or high. This is likely a flaw. The model will be
   **underconfident** (too wide) for low prices and dangerously
   **overconfident** (too narrow) for the more volatile high prices. This
   diagnostic clearly indicates that the model's uncertainty estimates are
   too simplistic and unreliable for risk management.

.. _gallery_plot_error_relationship:

-----------------------------------
Error vs. True Value Relationship
-----------------------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.relationship.plot_error_relationship` function
is a tool for going beyond simple error metrics and
understanding the *structure* of a model's errors. By plotting the
forecast error against the true observed value, it helps answer a
critical question: "Are my model's errors correlated with the magnitude
of the actual outcome?" Uncovering such a correlation is key to diagnosing
conditional biases and other hidden flaws.

First, let's break down the components of this diagnostic plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents the **true value** (:math:`y_{true}`),
     sorted and mapped to the angular axis. The plot spirals outwards as
     the true value increases. The angular labels are often hidden
     (``mask_angle=True``) as the progression is the key insight, not the
     specific values.
   * **Radius (r):** Represents the **forecast error** or residual
     (:math:`e = y_{true} - y_{pred}`). To handle positive and negative
     errors, the plot is shifted so that the radius represents the error
     relative to a "Zero Error" circle.
   * **Zero Error Circle:** The dashed black circle is the crucial
     reference. Points falling on this line had a perfect prediction
     (error = 0). Points **outside** the circle are **under-predictions**
     (positive error), while points **inside** are **over-predictions**
     (negative error).

Now, let's apply this diagnostic to a real-world problem to see how it
can reveal different types of model deficiencies.

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Diagnosing a Conditional Bias**

A common failure mode for regression models is a conditional bias, where
the model is accurate for a certain range of values but becomes
systematically biased for another.

Let's simulate a model for predicting house prices that performs well on
cheaper houses but consistently under-predicts the price of expensive
luxury homes.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd

   n_samples = 250
   # A skewed distribution of true house prices
   y_true = np.random.lognormal(mean=12.5, sigma=0.5, size=n_samples)
   # The model's error is proportional to the true value, causing under-prediction for high values
   bias = y_true * 0.15
   y_pred = y_true - bias + np.random.normal(0, 0.05 * y_true.max(), n_samples)

   :alt: An error relationship plot showing a clear drift in the error points.

   A spiral of error points that are centered on the zero-error line at
   small angles but drift progressively outwards at larger angles.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot provides an immediate diagnosis of a serious model flaw. For
   low true values (small angles, near the plot's start), the points are
   scattered symmetrically around the dashed "Zero Error" circle.
   However, as the true house price increases (as the spiral moves
   outwards), the entire cloud of error points **systematically drifts
   outside** the reference circle. This reveals a strong **conditional
   bias**: the model is accurate for low-priced homes but consistently
   **under-predicts** the value of high-priced homes, and the magnitude of
   this under-prediction grows with the price of the home.

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 2: Diagnosing Heteroscedasticity**

Another common issue is **heteroscedasticity**, where the *variance* of
the model's errors changes with the true value. The model might be very
consistent for one range of outcomes but become erratic and unpredictable
for another.

Let's simulate a scientific instrument that is very precise when measuring
small quantities but becomes much noisier and less reliable when measuring
large quantities.

   # The standard deviation of the error increases with the true value

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot reveals a different kind of problem. The cloud of error
   points remains **centered on the "Zero Error" circle** at all angles,
   indicating the model is unbiased. However, the **vertical spread** of
   the points (the width of the spiral) changes dramatically. It is very
   narrow for low true values (small angles) but "fans out," becoming
   much wider for high true values. This is the classic signature of
   **heteroscedasticity**. It tells us that while the model is accurate
   on average, its predictions become far more inconsistent and
   unreliable when measuring larger quantities.

Residual vs. Predicted Relationship
-------------------------------------

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.relationship.plot_residual_relationship`
function provides a polar version of the classic residual plot, a
fundamental diagnostic for any regression model. It is designed to
answer the question: "Are my model's errors correlated with its own
predictions?" Uncovering such a pattern is key to diagnosing issues like
heteroscedasticity and ensuring the model's reliability across its full
range of outputs.

First, let's break down the components of this essential diagnostic plot.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents the **predicted value** (:math:`y_{pred}`),
     sorted and mapped to the angular axis. The plot spirals outwards
     as the predicted value increases.
   * **Radius (r):** Represents the **forecast error** or residual
     (:math:`e = y_{true} - y_{pred}`). The plot is shifted so that the
     radius represents the error relative to the "Zero Error" circle.
   * **Zero Error Circle:** The dashed black circle is the reference line
     for a perfect prediction. Points **outside** the circle are
     **under-predictions**, while points **inside** are **over-predictions**.

Now, let's apply this diagnostic to a real-world problem to see how it can
reveal common model flaws.

.. raw:: html

   <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px 0;">

**Use Case 1: Diagnosing Heteroscedasticity**

The most critical use of this plot is to check for **heteroscedasticity**,
a condition where the variance of a model's errors is not constant. A
robust model should have errors that are equally spread out, regardless
of the magnitude of its prediction.

Let's simulate a model for predicting house prices that becomes more
erratic and less reliable when it predicts higher prices.

   This plot reveals a classic and critical model flaw. While the error
   points remain centered on the dashed "Zero Error" circle (indicating
   the model is unbiased), their **spread changes dramatically**. The
   points are tightly clustered for low predicted values (small angles) but
   "fan out," becoming much more widely scattered as the predicted price
   increases. This distinct **cone shape** is the unmistakable signature
   of **heteroscedasticity**. It tells us that the model's reliability is
   not constant; it is precise and trustworthy for low-priced homes but
   becomes highly inconsistent and unreliable when predicting high prices.

**Use Case 2: Identifying a Well-Behaved Model**

To appreciate a flawed model, it helps to see what a good one looks like.
A well-behaved model should produce residuals that are randomly and
uniformly scattered around the zero-error line, forming a spiral of
constant width.

Let's simulate a second, improved house price model that has overcome the
heteroscedasticity issue.

   A spiral of error points that maintains a consistent width and is
   symmetrically scattered around the zero-error reference circle.

.. topic:: 🧠 Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot is the signature of a **well-behaved, homoscedastic model**.
   The points form a spiral of **constant width**, and they are randomly
   and symmetrically scattered around the "Zero Error" circle at all
   angles (all prediction levels). This indicates that the variance of
   the model's errors is independent of the magnitude of its predictions.
   This is the ideal, textbook result for a residual plot and gives us
   confidence that the model is reliable across its entire operational
   range.

Practical Application: Regression Diagnosis

While the previous examples showcase each function individually, their
true analytical power is unleashed when used together in a structured
workflow. A robust model evaluation goes beyond a single plot; it involves
a systematic investigation from multiple angles to build a complete
picture of a model's behavior.

This case study will walk you through a realistic, multi-step analysis,
demonstrating how the plots from the ``relationship`` module can be
combined into a single, comprehensive diagnostic dashboard to solve a
complex modeling problem.

.. admonition:: Case Study: Modeling Corporate Growth
   :class: best-practice

   **The Business Problem:** An investment firm wants to model the
   relationship between a company's annual R&D spending and its subsequent
   revenue growth. Understanding this relationship is key to identifying
   high-potential investment opportunities.

   **The Models:** The data science team has developed two competing models:
   
   1. **"Linear Model":** A simple, interpretable model assuming a 
      straightforward, linear link between R&D and growth.
   2. **"ML Model":** A more complex machine learning model 
      (e.g., Gradient Boosting) capable of learning non-linear patterns and 
      providing probabilistic forecasts.

   **The Core Questions:** The firm needs a deep understanding of these 
   models before deploying them:
   
   1. What is the fundamental **response pattern** of each model? Does the 
      ML model's non-linearity seem plausible?
   2. How does the ML model's **uncertainty** change? Does it correctly 
      predict more uncertainty for high-growth companies?
   3. Do the models suffer from **hidden biases**? For instance, do they 
      systematically misjudge companies with very high or very low R&D spending?

Let's use ``k-diagram`` to create a 2x2 diagnostic dashboard to answer
all these questions at once.

   A comprehensive four-panel diagnostic plot comparing a linear and an
   ML model, showing their response patterns, uncertainty structures,
   and error characteristics.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This diagnostic dashboard provides a complete story, with each panel
   building on the last to deliver a rich and nuanced verdict on the two models.

   **Panel A (Model Response Patterns):** This high-level view immediately
   shows the difference in the models' fundamental behavior. The **Linear
   Model** (blue) forms a perfect, uniform spiral, confirming its simple
   straight-line assumption. In contrast, the **ML Model** (orange) forms
   a spiral that is compressed at higher angles (higher growth),
   correctly capturing the non-linear, saturating nature of the true data.
   This suggests the ML model is a better fit.

   **Panel B (Conditional Uncertainty):** Focusing on the ML model, this
   plot reveals how its uncertainty changes. The shaded quantile bands
   are narrow at low growth values (near the center) and become
   progressively **wider** as the true growth increases. This is a sign
   of a sophisticated model that has learned to be **heteroscedastic**—it
   correctly predicts higher uncertainty for the high-growth companies
   that are inherently more volatile.

   **Panel C (Error vs. True Growth):** This plot diagnoses conditional
   bias. The ML model's errors (cyan) are symmetrically scattered
   around the "Zero Error" circle at all angles, confirming it is
   **unbiased**. The Linear Model's errors (blue), however, show a
   systematic drift. They start inside the circle (over-prediction for
   low growth) and end up far outside it (severe under-prediction for high
   growth). This confirms the Linear Model is fundamentally misspecified.

   **Panel D (Residual vs. Predicted Growth):** This final check confirms
   our findings. The ML model's residuals (cyan) show a constant,
   random scatter, indicating its error variance is well-behaved. The
   Linear Model's residuals (blue) show a clear "frowning face" pattern,
   a classic sign of a misspecified model struggling to fit a non-linear
   relationship.

   **Overall Conclusion:** The dashboard provides overwhelming evidence
   that the **ML Model is superior in every aspect**. It not only fits the
   data better but also provides a realistic, heteroscedastic uncertainty
   estimate and produces well-behaved, unbiased residuals, making it a
   far more trustworthy tool for investment decisions.
