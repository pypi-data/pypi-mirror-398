class Broker(ManagerBase):
    """
    The ApiBroker class acts as an intermediary between the central router and all API handlers,
    managing client registrations, event dispatching, and communication in a multiprocessing
    environment. It extends ManagerBase to leverage common management functionalities and
    adds capabilities specific to API interactions.

    Attributes:
        api_broker_queue (Queue): A multiprocessing queue used to receive events specifically for the API broker.
        clients (Optional[Storage[Client]]): A storage mechanism for registered clients, allowing for quick access and management.
        db: Placeholder attribute for potential database connections or operations, not implemented by default.
        events (dict): A mapping of event resources to event classes, derived from the global api_events definition.
        middlewares_request (list[Middleware]): List of middlewares applied to incoming requests.
        middlewares_response (list[Middleware]): List of middlewares applied to outgoing responses.

    Methods:
        __init__(router_queue: "Queue[Event]", api_broker_queue: "Queue[Event]", middlewares: list[Middleware]):
            Constructor for the ApiBroker class.
        name (property): Returns the name of the ApiBroker instance.
        send_specific(event: Event): Sends an event to a specific client based on the event's key.
        send_all(event: Event): Broadcasts an event to all clients of a specific API type.
        client_register(event: client.Register): Registers a new client and sends a confirmation event.
        client_unregister(event: Event): Unregisters a client based on the event's key.
        event_register(event: manage.Register): Registers a client for specific events and parameters.
        solve(event: Event): Determines the appropriate method to handle an incoming event.
        _prepare(): Prepares the ApiBroker for operation by initializing storage for clients.
        additional_pipes (property): Returns a set of additional pipes to monitor for incoming events.
        run_resolver(): Main loop for processing incoming events and dispatching them to the appropriate handlers.
        resolve_callback(event: Event, pipe: Connection): Callback method for handling events received from clients.
        _prepare_resolvers(): Prepares resolvers for handling specific types of events.
        resolve(event: Event): Processes an event through the appropriate middlewares and forwards it to its destination.

    Usage:
        This class is instantiated with specific queues and is used within a multiprocessing
        application to manage communications between the router and API handlers. It handles
        client registrations, event dispatching, and utilizes middlewares for request and
