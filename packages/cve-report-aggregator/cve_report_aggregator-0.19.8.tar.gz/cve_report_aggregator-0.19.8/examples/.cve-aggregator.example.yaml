# ============================================================================
# Package Configuration
# ============================================================================
#
# The application supports mixed local and remote packages in a single configuration.
# Each package can specify its source as either "local" or "remote":
#
# Source Types:
#   - "local":  Package archive (.tar.zst) in ./packages/ directory
#   - "remote": Package will be downloaded from OCI registry
#
# Local Packages:
#   - Must exist in ./packages/ directory as: zarf-package-<name>-<architecture>-<version>.tar.zst
#   - Faster processing (no network I/O)
#   - Works in air-gapped environments
#   - Automatically extracted using: zarf package inspect
#
# Remote Packages:
#   - Downloaded from registry using UDS CLI
#   - Requires registry authentication (Docker config or UDS login)
#   - Command: uds zarf package inspect sbom <registry>/<organization>/<name>-<version> -a <architecture>
#
# Mixed Usage Example:
#   packages:
#     - name: gitlab              # From local archive
#       version: 18.4.2-uds.0-unicorn
#       architecture: amd64
#       source: local
#     - name: headlamp            # Downloaded from registry
#       version: 0.35.0-uds.0-registry1
#       architecture: amd64
#       source: remote
#
# ============================================================================

# Registry configuration (required for remote packages)
registry: registry.defenseunicorns.com
organization: sld-45

# Maximum number of concurrent workers for parallel processing
# Applies to both local package extraction and remote downloads
# Default: auto-detect (min(32, cpu_count + 4))
# Set to 1 to disable parallelization
# maxWorkers: 14

# Archive directory for bundled output artifacts
# When set, all output files (JSON reports, CSV exports, executive summary)
# are bundled into a single tarball: <archiveDir>/artifacts.tar.gz
# Useful for Docker deployments where a single mount point is preferred
# archiveDir: /home/cve-aggregator/archive

# List of packages to scan
# Each package must specify:
#   - name: Package name
#   - version: Package version
#   - architecture: Package architecture (default: amd64)
#   - source: "local" or "remote" (default: remote)
#
# Example configurations:
packages:
  # Local packages (from ./packages/ directory)
  - name: gitlab
    version: 18.4.2-uds.0-unicorn
    architecture: amd64
    source: local  # Must exist: ./packages/zarf-package-gitlab-amd64-18.4.2-uds.0-unicorn.tar.zst

  - name: gitlab-runner
    version: 18.4.0-uds.0-unicorn
    architecture: amd64
    source: local  # Must exist: ./packages/zarf-package-gitlab-runner-amd64-18.4.0-uds.0-unicorn.tar.zst

  # Remote packages (downloaded from registry)
  - name: headlamp
    version: 0.35.0-uds.0-registry1
    architecture: amd64
    source: remote  # Downloaded from: registry.defenseunicorns.com/sld-45/headlamp-0.35.0-uds.0-registry1:amd64

# Alternative: All remote packages (omit source field, defaults to "remote")
# packages:
#   - name: gitlab
#     version: 18.4.2-uds.0-unicorn
#     architecture: amd64
#   - name: gitlab-runner
#     version: 18.4.0-uds.0-unicorn
#     architecture: amd64

# CVE Enrichment with OpenRouter
# ============================================================================
#
# CVE enrichment provides:
#   1. Mitigation summary: How UDS Core security controls help mitigate each CVE
#   2. Impact analysis: Potential consequences if UDS Core controls were not in place
#
# Nested enrichment configuration
enrich:
  # Enable CVE enrichment
  enabled: false

  # Enrichment provider
  provider: openrouter

  # Model to use via OpenRouter
  # Examples: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1 (default), anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet, openai/gpt-4o
  model: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1

  # API key (can also use OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable)
  # apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

  # Reasoning effort level (minimal, low, medium, high)
  # - minimal: Fastest, most concise analysis
  # - low: Faster, more concise analysis with lower token usage
  # - medium: Balanced analysis with good quality and reasonable token usage (default)
  # - high: Most thorough analysis with highest quality but increased token usage
  # Default: medium
  reasoningEffort: medium

  # Verbosity level for model responses (low, medium, high)
  # - low: Most concise responses
  # - medium: Balanced responses (default)
  # - high: Most verbose responses
  # Default: medium
  verbosity: medium

  # Optional: Upper bound for total tokens including reasoning tokens
  # Useful for controlling costs with reasoning models
  # maxCompletionTokens: 650

  # Optional: Seed for reproducible results
  # seed: 42

  # Optional: Metadata tags for requests (key-value pairs)
  # Useful for tracking and categorization
  # metadata:
  #   project: cve-report-aggregator
  #   organization: defenseunicorns
  #   environment: production

  # Severity levels to enrich (list)
  # Only CVEs with these severity levels will be enriched
  # Default: ["Critical", "High"]
  severities:
    - Critical
    - High
    # - Medium
    # - Low

  # Maximum concurrent API requests for enrichment
  # Higher values speed up enrichment but may hit rate limits
  # Valid range: 1-20
  # Default: 5
  maxWorkers: 5
