"""
A module providing support for messaging and communication using RabbitMQ as the backend.

This module includes functionality for publishing, subscribing, and managing message queues,
as well as dynamically managing imports and configurations for RabbitMQ-based communication
logics. It enables both synchronous and asynchronous operations, while also supporting
connection resetting and management.

Modules and functionality are primarily imported from the core RabbitMQ backend, dynamically
generated package-specific configurations, and other base utilities. Exports are adjusted
as per the backend configuration.
