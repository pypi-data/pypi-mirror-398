# Cas2JSON

[![code style: ruff](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astral-sh/ruff/main/assets/badge/v2.json)](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)

A library to parse CAS (Consolidated Account Statement) from providers like CAMS, KFINTECH, NSDL (BETA) , CDSL (BETA) and get related data in JSON format.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -U cas2json
```

## Usage

```python
# For CAMS/KFINTECH
from cas2json import parse_cams_pdf
data = parse_cams_pdf("/path/to/cams/file.pdf", "password")

# For NSDL
from cas2json import parse_nsdl_pdf
data = parse_nsdl_pdf("/path/to/nsdl/file.pdf", "password")

#For CDSL
from cas2json import parse_cdsl_pdf
data = parse_cdsl_pdf("/path/to/cdsl/file.pdf", "password")

# To get data in form of Python dict
from dataclasses import asdict
python_dict = asdict(data)

# To convert the data from python dict to JSON
from msgspec import json
json_data = json.encode(python_dict)


```

Notes:
- All used types like transaction types can be found under `cas2json/enums.py`.
- NSDL/CDSL currently supports only parsing of holdings since the transactions history is not complete.

## Credits

This library is inspired by [CASParser](https://github.com/codereverser/casparser), but it is an independent reimplementation with significant changes in both design and processing logic. In particular, it introduces a revised method for parsing textual data and for accurately identifying transaction values, even in cases where one or more trailing values may be missing from the record.
