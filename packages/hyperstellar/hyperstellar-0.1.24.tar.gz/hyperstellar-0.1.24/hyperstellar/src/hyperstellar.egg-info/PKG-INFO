# Hyperstellar
### Write math Equations in python

Buckle up, coz this isn't just another preset physics engine. Hyperstellar gives you the mathematical language to define *any* dynamical system, then GPU-accelerates it to thousands of frames per second. From orbital mechanics to fluid dynamics, if you can write the equation, you can simulate it.
