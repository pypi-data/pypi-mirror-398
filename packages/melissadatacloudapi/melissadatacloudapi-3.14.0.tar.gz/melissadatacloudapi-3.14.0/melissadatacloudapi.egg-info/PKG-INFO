# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the package integrated into your development environment.

### Licensing

All Melissa cloud services require a license to use. This license is an encrypted series of letters, numbers, and symbols. This license can also either be a Credit license or a Subscription license. Both ways use the same service, so you do not need to change your code to move from one model to another.

### Installation

**To integrate the package source code with another Python project, proceed with the following instructions:**

### Install with pip - reccommended method

1. Ensure that you have pip installed on your machine. You can check this by using : 
    ```
    pip --version
    ```
    For information on installing and using pip please see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
    
2. Run the command:
    ```
    pip install melissadatacloudapi
    ```
3. Add to your project:
    ```
    import melissadatacloudapi
    ```
    Or if you want to only add specific classes add something like this:
    ```
    from melissadatacloudapi.RecordRequests import GlobalPhoneRecordRequest
    from melissadatacloudapi.cloudapis.GlobalPhone import GlobalPhone
    from melissadatacloudapi.apiresponse import GlobalPhoneResponse
    from melissadatacloudapi.PostReqestBase import GlobalPhonePostRequest
    ```

#### Import to your project manually

1.  Navigate to the project directory where you would like to add the package.

2.  Clone the package repository using the command:
    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/MelissaData/MelissaCloudAPI-PyPI](https://github.com/MelissaData/MelissaCloudAPI-PyPI)
    ```
    This will create a directory named `MelissaCloudAPI-PyPI` in your current location.

3.  Locate the package files: Inside the `MelissaCloudAPI-PyPI` directory, you will find the actual package files within a subdirectory also named `melissadatacloudapi`.

4.  Copy the `melissadatacloudapi` directory: Copy the entire `melissadatacloudapi` directory.

5.  Navigate to your project's main directory.

6.  Paste the `melissadatacloudapi` directory into your project's main directory. Your project structure should now look something like this (example):

    ```
    your_project/
    ├── your_script.py
    ├── ...
    └── melissadatacloudapi/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── cloudapis/
        │   ├── ...
        ├── apiresponse/
