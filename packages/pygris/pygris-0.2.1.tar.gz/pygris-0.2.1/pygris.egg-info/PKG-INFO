## pygris

__pygris__ is a Python package to help users access US Census Bureau TIGER/Line and cartographic boundary shapefiles and load them into Python as GeoDataFrames.  The goal of the package is to make it simple to access US Census geographic data; data can be acquired with a single function for a given geography (e.g. `tracts()` for Census tracts) along with a few options.  

The package is a general port of the [R __tigris__ package](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) with a few modifications.  The framework of and philosophy behind the __tigris__ package is covered in [Chapter 5 of my book, _Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps and Models in R_](https://walker-data.com/census-r/census-geographic-data-and-applications-in-r.html).  

Install __pygris__ from PyPI with the following command:

```bash
pip install pygris

# For optional dependencies to support interactive examples in the documentation:
# pip install pygris[explore]
```

Or via `conda-forge` with:

```bash
conda install pygris

# For optional dependencies to support interactive examples in the documentation:
# conda install "pygris[explore]"
```

Alternatively, install the development version from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/walkerke/pygris.git
```

Support for installation with `conda` is forthcoming.
