# MIRA3 - Memory Information Retriever and Archiver

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Interstitch%2FMIRA3-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/Interstitch/MIRA3)

An MCP server that gives Claude Code persistent memory across sessions.

## The Problem

Every Claude Code session starts fresh. Claude doesn't remember:
- That you fixed this exact error last Tuesday
- That `config.py` breaks every time someone touches it
- That you prefer tests before implementation
- What you were even working on yesterday

You end up re-explaining context, re-debugging solved problems, and watching Claude confidently break files that have burned you before.

## The Solution

**MIRA gives Claude a memory.** Ask things like:

> *"What were we working on last week?"*
> *"How did we fix that authentication bug?"*
> *"Show me the code we used for the caching layer"*

And Claude just *knows* - no re-explanation needed.

## What This Actually Looks Like

**Scenario 1: You forgot where you left off**
```
You: What was I working on Friday?
Claude: [Calls mira_recent(days=3)] You had 2 sessions Friday:
        1. Implementing sync worker retry logic - got it working
        2. Debugging the connection pool - noted you wanted exponential backoff
```

**Scenario 2: You want to reuse a solution from another project**
```
You: How did we implement rate limiting in the API project?
Claude: [Searches across projects] Found it in api-gateway (Nov 15). You used
        a token bucket algorithm with Redis. Want me to show the implementation?
```

**Scenario 3: You're about to touch a cursed file**
```
You: Let's refactor ingestion.py
Claude: ⚠️ Heads up - ingestion.py has caused 51 recorded issues in past sessions.
        Want me to search what went wrong before to avoid repeating mistakes?
```

## Key Features

- **Zero-configuration context** - Claude knows who you are the moment a session starts
- **Semantic search** - Find "that auth conversation" even if you never used that word
- **Error pattern database** - Indexed errors linked to solutions
- **Danger zone warnings** - Claude warns before touching files that caused past issues
- **Workflow enforcement** - MIRA detects your dev pattern (test first? plan first?) and Claude enforces it
- **Decision journal** - Track architectural decisions with reasoning

## Installation

```bash
pip install claude-mira
mira-install
```

That's it. The `mira-install` command configures Claude Code to use MIRA as an MCP server. Restart Claude Code after installation.

The SessionStart hook auto-configures on install, injecting MIRA context at the start of every Claude Code session.

**First search:** When you first search, MIRA downloads a ~100MB embedding model in the background for local semantic search. This only happens once. (If you [set up remote storage](#remote-storage-optional) first, the server handles embeddings and this download is skipped.)

### Configuration

MIRA configuration is stored in `.mira/config.json`:

```json
{
  "project_path": "/workspaces/MIRA3"
}
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `project_path` | Restrict MIRA to only index this project's conversations |

## How It Works

**The magic is in the SessionStart hook.** Before you type anything, MIRA injects your profile:

```
=== MIRA Session Context ===

## User Profile
Name: Alex
Summary: Alex is the lead developer (123 sessions). Prefers planning before implementation.
Development Lifecycle: Plan → Test → Implement → Commit (85% confidence)
Interaction Tips:
  - Be careful with: ingestion.py (51 recorded issues)

## When to Consult MIRA
- [CRITICAL] Encountering an error → call mira_error_lookup first
- [CRITICAL] About to say "I don't know" → search MIRA before admitting ignorance
- [CRITICAL] User mentions past discussions → search MIRA to recall context
```

**What this means:**
- Claude addresses you by name without asking
- Claude follows your preferred workflow (test first? plan first?)
- Claude warns before touching files that caused past issues
- Claude searches your history before saying "I don't know"

No manual prompting. No "remember that I prefer..." every session. MIRA learns from your conversations and Claude just *knows*.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mira_init` | Session initialization (called automatically via hook) |
| `mira_search` | Search conversations by meaning |
| `mira_recent` | Recent sessions. Use `days: 7` for last week |
| `mira_error_lookup` | Search past errors and their solutions |
| `mira_decisions` | Search architectural decisions |
| `mira_code_history` | Track file/function changes across sessions |
| `mira_status` | System health and ingestion stats |

### Search Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | string | required | Search query |
| `limit` | number | 10 | Maximum results |
| `days` | number | - | Filter to last N days |
| `recency_bias` | boolean | true | Boost recent results. Set `false` for historical searches |
| `compact` | boolean | true | Compact format (~79% smaller) |

## Search Features

### Semantic Search

MIRA finds conversations by meaning, not just keywords. Search for "authentication bug" and find discussions about "login issues" or "JWT token problems."

**Local mode:** On first search, MIRA downloads `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (~100MB ONNX model via fastembed). Vectors are stored in SQLite with sqlite-vec. All processing happens locally.

**Remote mode:** If you configure [remote storage](#remote-storage-optional), the embedding-service on your server handles vector generation using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (sentence-transformers) with Qdrant for storage and search. No model download needed on client machines.

### Time Decay

Results are ranked with exponential time decay - recent conversations surface first:

| Age | Score Multiplier |
|-----|------------------|
| Today | 1.00 |
| 30 days | 0.79 |
| 90 days | 0.50 |
| 1 year | 0.10 (floor) |

Disable with `recency_bias: false` for historical searches like "original architecture decision".

### Fuzzy Matching

Typos are auto-corrected:
```
Query: "authentcation implementaton"
       ↓ (auto-corrected)
Search: "authentication implementation"
```

## Data & Indexing

MIRA stores data in `<workspace>/.mira/`. When a new conversation is detected, it extracts and indexes:

| What's Extracted | Stored In | Purpose |
|------------------|-----------|---------|
| Summary, keywords, metadata | `local_store.db` | FTS5 full-text search |
| Semantic vectors | `local_vectors.db` | Meaning-based search |
| Error patterns & solutions | `insights.db` | `mira_error_lookup` |
| Architectural decisions | `insights.db` | `mira_decisions` |
| Code blocks, commands, configs | `artifacts.db` | Structured content retrieval |
| User profile, preferences | `custodian.db` | Session context injection |
| Conversation copies | `archives/` | Offline search, excerpts |
| Python dependencies | `.venv/` | ~50MB runtime |

**Filtering:** Agent sub-conversations and empty sessions are skipped automatically.

## Learning Features

### Custodian Profile

MIRA builds your profile from conversations:

- **Identity** - Your name (from "I'm Sarah" or similar)
- **Preferences** - Tool preferences, coding style
- **Rules** - "never commit to main", "always run tests first"
- **Danger zones** - Files that have caused repeated issues
- **Workflow** - Your development pattern (test first? plan first?)

### Environment Prerequisites

State prerequisites naturally and MIRA remembers:

```
"In Codespaces, I need to start tailscaled first"
"On my workstation, run docker-compose up before tests"
```

MIRA detects your environment and reminds you in future sessions.

### Decision Journal

Record decisions explicitly for high confidence:

```
"Decision: use PostgreSQL for the database"
"ADR: all API responses include meta field"
"Going forward, use pnpm instead of npm"
```

Search with `mira_decisions` to understand past choices.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code ←→ stdio ←→ MIRA (Python MCP Server) ←→ SQLite (FTS5 + vectors)
```

- **Pure Python MCP server** using the official MCP Python SDK
- **File watching**: Automatic ingestion of new conversations
- **SQLite**: FTS5 for text search, sqlite-vec for semantic search
- **Optional remote storage**: Postgres + Qdrant for cross-machine sync

## FAQ

**How long until MIRA learns my name?**
Usually 1-2 sessions. Just mention it naturally: "I'm Sarah" or sign off with your name.

**Does MIRA read my code?**
No. MIRA only indexes Claude Code conversation history. It never reads your source code files directly.

**Does MIRA store code from my conversations?**
Yes. Code snippets, commands, and configs discussed in conversations are stored in MIRA's local SQLite databases (in `.mira/`). This data stays on your machine and is only exchanged with Claude Code during your sessions. If you configure remote storage, conversation data syncs to your server - but never to any third-party service.

**How do I teach MIRA my workflow?**
Just work normally. MIRA detects patterns: if you consistently write tests before implementing, it learns that as your workflow.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- Claude Code

**Note:** MIRA has only been tested on Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Codespaces). macOS and Windows support is untested.

## Known Limitations

**Fresh Install Testing:** Most development has been done on systems with existing MIRA data. Fresh installs have received limited testing. If you encounter issues during initial setup, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Interstitch/MIRA3/issues).

**Local Semantic Search (sqlite-vec):** Local semantic search requires the sqlite-vec extension, which needs Python compiled with `--enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions`. Many Python builds (including pyenv defaults and some Codespaces environments) lack this. In these environments, local semantic search gracefully falls back to FTS5 keyword search. The fastembed model still downloads but won't be used until sqlite-vec works. Remote storage (if configured) handles semantic search server-side and bypasses this limitation.

---

## Remote Storage (Optional)

> **Most users don't need this.** Local semantic search works out of the box. Remote storage is only for users who want history to sync across multiple machines or share between team members.

Remote storage enables:
- **Cross-machine sync** - History follows you across laptop, desktop, Codespaces
- **Persistent memory** - Rebuild a Codespace and your history is already there
- **Team sharing** - Multiple developers share the same memory pool

### Quick Setup

**On your server** (any Linux machine with Docker):

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Interstitch/MIRA3/master/server/install.sh | bash
```

The script prompts for server IP, PostgreSQL password, and Qdrant API key.
