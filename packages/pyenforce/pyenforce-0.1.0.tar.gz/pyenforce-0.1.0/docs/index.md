  <b>A unified CLI for Python code quality</b>
</p>

## What is PyEnforce?

PyEnforce wraps industry-standard static analysis tools with strict, curated configurations. One command, consistent quality across your entire Python project.

## Why Choose PyEnforce?

Tired of juggling multiple code quality tools? Each one comes with its own configuration files, installation steps, and command syntax. You spend more time setting up tools than actually improving your code.

**PyEnforce solves this problem.** Stop wrestling with configurations and start shipping better code.

### Stop Configuration Headaches

No more hunting for the "right" settings or copying config files between projects. PyEnforce comes with **strict, battle-tested configurations** that work out of the box. Just install and run—your code quality standards are already defined. Spend your time writing code, not configuring tools.

### One Interface, All Tools

Instead of remembering `ruff check`, `mypy .`, `pylint src/`, and different flags for each tool, use one consistent command: `pye <tool>`. Same syntax, same workflow, less cognitive load. One command to rule them all.

### Consistency Across Projects

Whether you're working on a solo project or a team of 50, PyEnforce ensures everyone uses the same quality standards. No more "it works on my machine" or "we use different lint rules." **One standard, everywhere.** Eliminate the guesswork and enforce quality at scale.

### Comprehensive Coverage

PyEnforce integrates six industry-standard tools:
- **Ruff** - Lightning-fast linting and formatting
- **Mypy** - Static type checking
- **Pylint** - Code quality analysis
- **Bandit** - Security vulnerability detection
- **Semgrep** - Advanced security and bug detection
- **Vulture** - Dead code detection

All configured, all ready to use. No setup required—just run and go.
