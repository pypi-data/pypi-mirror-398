### Reporting a Vulnerability
We take the security of `pygha` seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

1. GitHub Private Reporting (Preferred):

2. Email:
    * If GitHub Private Reporting is not available, please email the maintainer directly at parneetsingh022@gmail.com
    * Please include "SECURITY:pygha" in the subject line.

### Security Measures
We proactively use the following tools in our CI/CD pipeline to ensure code security:
* Bandit: Scans Python code for common security issues.
* CodeQL: Performs semantic code analysis to find vulnerabilities.
* Dependency Review: Checks pull requests for vulnerable dependencies.

## Disclosure Policy
* We aim to acknowledge your report as soon as possible, typically within 48 hours.
* We will provide an estimated timeline for a fix once the issue is analyzed.
