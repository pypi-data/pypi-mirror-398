"""Color palettes and scale utilities for shinymap.

This subpackage provides:
- Pre-defined color palettes for different use cases
- Color scale functions for mapping data to colors

Palette Categories:
    - neutral: Default/fallback colors
    - qualitative: Distinct colors for categorical data
    - sequential: Ordered palettes for count/continuous data
    - binary: Two-state palettes for Single/Multiple modes
    - cycle: Multi-state palettes for Cycle mode

Scale Functions:
    - scale_sequential: Map counts to sequential colors
    - scale_diverging: Map values to diverging colors (red-white-blue)
    - scale_qualitative: Map categories to distinct colors
    - lerp_hex: Interpolate between two hex colors

Usage:
    >>> from shinymap.color import SEQUENTIAL_BLUE, scale_sequential
    >>> from shinymap.color import HUE_CYCLE_4, BINARY_TOGGLE
