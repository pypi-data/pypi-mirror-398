## What We Learned

**Team Work Insights**

- Clear communication matters more than formal roles in small teams
- Documenting decisions early saves time later
- Mutual agreement on next steps is essential

**Research Insights**

- Existing tools are either too basic or have different goals
- Understanding what changes are made is as important as the changes metrics
- Customer wants to save time on code review

## Questions That Need Answers

- What's more valuable: recent code changes analysis or long-term code file trends analysis?
- Should the output be text in the terminal or text/PDF output files?
- Should we have a list of LLM models to choose from?
- Will it be enough to rely on the accuracy of the used model?

## Next Steps

- Create simple CLI interface for summary viewing
- Test with real open-source projects to validate value
- Gather feedback from customer on what insights are most useful
- Schedule meetings offline or communication through Telegram
