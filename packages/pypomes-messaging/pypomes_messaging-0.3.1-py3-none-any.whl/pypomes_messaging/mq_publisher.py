    A wrapper on *pika*, an implementation of the publisher side of a *RabbitMQ* client.

    This is an example of a publisher that can handle unexpected interactions with *RabbitMQ*,
    such as channel closing and connection interruptions.

    If *RabbitMQ* closes the connection, this implementation will attempt to reopen it.
    In these case, the execution log should be examined, as there are only a few reasons
     to justify the closing of the connection, and they are usually related to permissions or
    time limitations on the use of sockets.

    This implementation uses delivery confirmation, by providing a means to follow up
    on message delivery, and verify if such deliveries were confirme by *RabbitMQ*.
