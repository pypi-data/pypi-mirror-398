# News

 - Volumetric version of graynet is available now - [check here](https://raamana.github.io/graynet/volumetric.html)


# Overview

Individualized single-subject networks from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features such as:
  - vertex-wise features such as cortical thickness, gyrification and curavature
  - volumetric features such as gray matter density (T1w images) or metabolic uptake (PET) or another voxel-wise feature
  - Subcortical morphometric features
  - or any other similar feature distributed over a domain (cortex, or whole brain) to enable compuatation of inter-regional edge weights

Applicable for whenever network-level features are useful, among which common use cases are: 
 - Biomarker development.
 - Brain-behaviour relationships (e.g. for the diagnosis and prognosis of many brain disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Schizophrenia and the like).
 - Aging (changes in network properties over age and their relations to other variables).
