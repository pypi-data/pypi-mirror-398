    """Apply Rule 10: Multi-Segment Consistency (NEW - PRIORITY 3).

    Validates that anomalies are consistent throughout the file.

    Method:
    1. Divide file into 5 segments (Start, 25%, 50%, 75%, End)
    2. Detect cutoff for each segment
    3. Analyze consistency

    Actions:
    - Cutoffs vary > 1000 Hz: -20 points (Dynamic mastering, not global transcoding)
    - Only one problematic segment (score > 50): -30 points (Local artifact)
    - All segments consistent (variance < 500 Hz): 0 points (Confirms transcoding or authenticity)

    Activation:
    - Only if current score > 30 (already suspect)

    Args:
        filepath: Path to the FLAC file
        current_score: Current accumulated score from other rules
        sample_rate: Sample rate in Hz
        container_bitrate: Container bitrate in kbps
