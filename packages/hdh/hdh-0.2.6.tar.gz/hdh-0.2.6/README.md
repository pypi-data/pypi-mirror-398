## What is a HDH?

**HDH (Hybrid Dependency Hypergraph)** is an intermediate directed hypergraph-based representation designed to encode the dependecies arising in any quantum workload.
It provides a unified structure that makes it easier to:

- Translate quantum programs (e.g., a circuit or a mbqc pattern) into a unified hypergraph format
- Analyze and visualize the logical and temporal dependencies within a computation
- Partition workloads across devices, taking into account hardware and network constraints

---

## Current Capabilities

- Qiskit, Braket, Cirq and Pennylane circuit mappings to HDHs
- OpenQASM 2.0 file parsing  
- Model-specific abstractions for:
  - Quantum Circuits
  - Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC)
  - Quantum Walks
  - Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA)
- Capability to partition HDHs and evaluate partitions

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install hdh
```
---
## Quickstart

### From Qiskit

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from hdh.converters import from_qiskit
from hdh.visualize import plot_hdh

qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)

hdh = from_qiskit(qc)

plot_hdh(hdh)
```

### From QASM file

```python
from hdh.converters import from_qasm
from hdh.visualize import plot_hdh

qasm_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'test_qasm_file.qasm')
hdh = from_qasm('file', qasm_path)

plot_hdh(hdh)
```
---

## Tests and Demos

All tests are under `tests/` and can be run with:

```bash
pytest
```
