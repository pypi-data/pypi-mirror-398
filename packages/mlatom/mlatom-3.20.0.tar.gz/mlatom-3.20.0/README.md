MLatom is a program package for AI-enhanced computational chemistry. It is designed to leverage the power of ML to speed up and make more accurate common simulations and to create complex workflows.

The users can run simulations with input files, Python script, and command-line options. More information about MLatom and its developers is on [MLatom.com](http://mlatom.com).
MLatom can be also used on the [XACS cloud computing](https://XACScloud.com) platform.
