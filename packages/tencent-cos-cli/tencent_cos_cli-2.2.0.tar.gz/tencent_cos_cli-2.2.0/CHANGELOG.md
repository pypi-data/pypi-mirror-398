  - New `--action` option: Specify custom CAM actions (repeatable)
  - New `--read-only` flag: Quick mode for read-only access
- **Policy Building**: Automatic CAM policy generation for scoped access
  - `build_policy()` function: Constructs resource-restricted policies
  - Support for prefix-based wildcards (`prefix/*`)
  - Bucket-level operations (ListMultipartUploads, ListParts)
- **APPID Extraction**: Automatic extraction from bucket names
  - `extract_appid_from_bucket()` validates 10-digit APPID format
- **Bucket Validation**: `validate_bucket_name()` with Tencent COS rules
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 26 tests for token functionality (100% passing)
  - Policy building tests (6)
  - APPID extraction tests (5)
  - CLI integration tests (11)
  - STS manager tests (4)
- **Documentation Updates**:
  - [STS_PREFIX_ACCESS_GUIDE.md](docs/STS_PREFIX_ACCESS_GUIDE.md) - Complete guide with examples
  - [TOKEN_USAGE_GUIDE.md](docs/TOKEN_USAGE_GUIDE.md) - Token management patterns
  - [CREDENTIAL_PRECEDENCE.md](docs/CREDENTIAL_PRECEDENCE.md) - **NEW**: Complete credential resolution rules
  - [SECURITY_REVIEW.md](SECURITY_REVIEW.md) - Security audit and sanitization

### Changed
- **Default Region**: Changed from ap-singapore to ap-shanghai globally
- **STSTokenManager**: Enhanced to support policy-based credentials
  - Disables caching when policy provided (ensures fresh scoped tokens)
  - Accepts both policy dict and policy string
- **Token Output**: Fixed Click echo issues (removed unsupported `end` parameter)
- **Credential Resolution**: **MAJOR REFACTOR** - Clear precedence rules
  - `get_credentials()`: Explicit mode detection prevents conflicts
  - Environment `COS_TOKEN` now completely isolates from config file
  - Added `_source` field to track credential origin
  - Validation ensures temporary credentials are complete
  - See [CREDENTIAL_PRECEDENCE.md](docs/CREDENTIAL_PRECEDENCE.md) for full details

### Fixed
- **Credential Conflicts**: Environment temporary tokens no longer conflict with config `assume_role`
  - When `COS_TOKEN` is set, config file is completely bypassed
  - Prevents mixed credential sources causing ambiguous behavior
  - Clear error messages when temporary credentials are incomplete
- **GetBucket Permission**: Listing now works with prefix-restricted tokens
  - Removed restrictive prefix condition on GetBucket action
  - Object access still properly restricted to specified prefix
  - Policy allows listing entire bucket but only accessing objects within prefix
  - See [STS_PREFIX_ACCESS_GUIDE.md](docs/STS_PREFIX_ACCESS_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting) for details

### Security
- **Sanitized Documentation**: Removed all production bucket names and real account identifiers
- **Generic Examples**: All docs now use placeholder values (my-bucket-1234567890, etc.)

  - Previously would create directory object instead of file
- **Help formatting**: Fixed indentation in all command help texts
  - All examples now display with proper 2-space indentation
  - Line breaks preserved correctly using Click's `\b` marker
- **token command**: Fixed environment variable output for sourcing
  - Info messages now go to stderr when `--output env`
  - Clean stdout allows: `cos token --output env > creds.sh && source creds.sh`
