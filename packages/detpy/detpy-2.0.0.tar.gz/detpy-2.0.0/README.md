```

# Using FunctionLoader

You can also use one of predefined functions to solve your problem. 
To do this, call the FunctionLoader method and pass as an argument the name of a function from the folder and variables,
which u want to use in your calculations.

```
function_loader = FunctionLoader()
function_name = "ackley"
variables = [0.0, 0.0]
n_dimensions = 2

result = function_loader.evaluate_function(function_name, variables, n_dimensions)
```
