    Implements the 'current-to-pbest/r' mutation method.

        Formula: bm + Fw * (bm_best - bm) + F * (r1 - r2)

        Parameters:
        - base_member (Member): The base member used for the mutation operation.
        - best_member (Member): The best member, typically the one with the best fitness value, used in the mutation formula.
        - r1 (Member): A randomly selected member from the population based on rank selection, used for mutation.
        - r2 (Member): Another randomly selected member from the population based on rank selection, used for mutation.
        - f (float): A scaling factor for the first part equation.
        - fw (float): A scaling factor for the second part equation.

        Returns: A new member with the mutated chromosomes.
