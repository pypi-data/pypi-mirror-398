        Performs the mutation operation.

        Parameters:
        - base_member (Member): The base member used for the mutation operation.
        - best_member (Member): The best member, typically the one with the best fitness value, used in the mutation formula.
        - r1 (Member): A randomly selected member from the population, used for mutation. (rank selection)
        - r2 (Member): Another randomly selected member from the archive, used for mutation.
        - f (float): A scaling factor that controls the magnitude of the mutation between random members of the population.

        Returns:
        - Member: A new member with the mutated chromosomes.
