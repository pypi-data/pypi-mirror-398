# GTM Engineer Archetypes

## Overview

GTM Engineering is not one thing. Different companies, motions, and stages require different specializations. Understanding these archetypes helps you:

1. Identify what type of GTM work you're dealing with
2. Apply the right patterns and tools
3. Know where your expertise applies (and where it doesn't)
4. Adapt your approach to context

## The Six Archetypes

### 1. Outbound Systems Builder

## Archetype Combinations

Most GTM Engineers are combinations of archetypes. Common pairings:

| Combination | Context |
|-------------|---------|
| Outbound + AI Orchestrator | High-volume outbound with AI qualification |
| RevOps + Data Engineer | Enterprise with complex reporting needs |
| PLG + AI Orchestrator | Product-led with intelligent engagement |
| Full-Stack → Specialist | Early-stage evolving to focus area |

## Identifying Your Archetype

Ask these questions:

1. **What's the primary GTM motion?**
   - Outbound-led → Outbound Systems Builder
   - Product-led → PLG/Growth Engineer
   - Inbound-led → Consider RevOps or Data focus

2. **What's the company stage?**
   - Early (pre-revenue) → Full-Stack Generalist
   - Growth (scaling) → Specialist in bottleneck area
   - Enterprise (optimizing) → RevOps or Data Engineer

3. **What's the biggest problem?**
   - "We can't generate enough pipeline" → Outbound
   - "We don't know what's working" → Data/Analytics
   - "Our CRM is a mess" → RevOps
   - "We need to do more with less" → AI Orchestrator
   - "Users aren't converting" → PLG

## Key Insight

**There is no "best" archetype.** The right one depends on:
- Company stage
- GTM motion (sales-led, product-led, hybrid)
- Available resources
- Current bottlenecks
- Market and product characteristics

A great GTM Engineer knows which hat to wear and when to change hats.
