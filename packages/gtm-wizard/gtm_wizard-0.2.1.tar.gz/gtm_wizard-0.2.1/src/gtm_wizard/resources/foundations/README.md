## How to Use These Foundations

1. **New to GTM Engineering?** Start with "What is GTM Engineering?"
2. **Trying to identify your focus?** Read "GTM Archetypes"
3. **Solving a specific problem?** Use "Context Factors" to adapt approaches
4. **Using GTM Wizard tools?** Remember "Principles, Not Recipes"

## For AI Agents

When helping users with GTM problems:

1. **First, identify context** - Use the 8 context factors
2. **Then, identify archetype** - What type of GTM work is this?
3. **Apply principles** - Not templates
4. **Adapt to specifics** - Every situation is different

Never provide a solution without first understanding the user's context.
