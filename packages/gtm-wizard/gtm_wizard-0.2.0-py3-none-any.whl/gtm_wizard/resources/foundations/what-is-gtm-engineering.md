# What is GTM Engineering?

## Definition

A **GTM Engineer** (Go-to-Market Engineer) is a hybrid role that combines technical expertise with commercial understanding to build, automate, and scale revenue-generating systems.

> "Half commercial thinker, half builder" - Clay

GTM Engineers are the architects of the systems and processes that power everything from lead generation to customer onboarding. They don't just use tools - they connect them, automate them, and optimize them for revenue impact.

## Why This Role Emerged

### The Complexity Problem

1. **Martech explosion**: Over 11,000+ marketing technology solutions exist today (Chiefmartec, 2024)
2. **Integration chaos**: Companies use 20-100+ tools that need to work together
3. **AI acceleration**: LLMs, agents, and AI workflows require technical implementation
4. **Scale demands**: Manual processes don't scale; automation is mandatory

### The Gap It Fills

| Traditional Role | What They Lack | GTM Engineer Adds |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Sales Ops | Deep technical skills | API fluency, custom automation |
| Marketing Ops | Systems thinking | Pipeline architecture, data flows |
| RevOps | Building capability | Code, integrations, AI workflows |
| Software Engineer | Commercial context | Revenue focus, GTM understanding |

## Timeline

- **2000-2023**: Role didn't exist as a distinct category
- **2024**: Early adopters, pioneering companies create the function
- **2025**: 205% year-over-year growth in GTM Engineer job postings
- **Future**: Projected to become one of the most important revenue team roles

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Systems Integration & Tech Stack Management
- Design how tools connect (CRM, automation, enrichment, outreach)
- Build data pipelines that move information reliably
- Ensure clean data flows across the revenue stack

### 2. Automation & Workflow Design
- Eliminate manual tasks through automation
- Build conditional logic (if-then workflows)
- Create scalable processes that work without human intervention

### 3. Data & Analytics
- Build dashboards and reporting
- Track metrics (CAC, LTV, conversion rates, pipeline velocity)
- Enable data-driven decision making

### 4. AI & LLM Implementation
- Deploy AI for lead scoring, qualification, personalization
- Build agent workflows
- Optimize prompts and AI systems for GTM use cases

### 5. Lead Management
- Design qualification logic
- Build scoring models
- Create routing rules

## What Makes a Good GTM Engineer

### Technical Skills
- **API fluency**: Comfortable connecting systems via APIs
- **Automation platforms**: Clay, n8n, Zapier, Make, custom code
- **CRM expertise**: Deep knowledge of Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.
- **Data skills**: SQL (38% of jobs require it), Python (38%), basic scripting
- **AI/LLM skills**: Prompt engineering, agent orchestration

### Commercial Skills
- **Revenue understanding**: Know how pipeline, conversion, and metrics work
- **Sales cycle knowledge**: Understand stages, handoffs, timing
- **ROI thinking**: Always ask "does this actually close deals?"
- **Funnel intuition**: See where value is created and lost

### Soft Skills
- **Problem-solving**: Diagnose broken workflows, identify bottlenecks
- **Communication**: Explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- **Adaptability**: Markets change, priorities shift, tools evolve
- **Curiosity**: Approach GTM puzzles investigatively

## GTM Engineer vs. Related Roles

| Role | Focus | GTM Engineer Difference |
|------|-------|------------------------|
| **RevOps** | Strategy, process design, governance | GTM Engineers BUILD; RevOps DESIGNS |
| **Sales Ops** | Sales team support | GTM Engineers span full funnel |
| **Marketing Ops** | Campaign execution | GTM Engineers focus on systems, not campaigns |
| **Growth Engineer** | Product/feature growth | GTM Engineers focus on revenue systems |
| **Data Engineer** | Data infrastructure | GTM Engineers are revenue-focused |

### The Simple Distinction

## Compensation (2025)

| Level | Salary Range (US) |
|-------|-------------------|
| Entry/Junior | $70,000 - $90,000 |
| Mid-Level | $90,000 - $120,000 |
| Senior | $120,000 - $160,000 |
| Lead/Principal | $160,000 - $200,000+ |

## Key Insight

GTM Engineering isn't just about being technical. The engineers making the biggest impact combine:
- Code expertise WITH customer understanding
- Automation skills WITH revenue focus
- Technical depth WITH strategic thinking

They build systems that don't just automate tasks, but actually improve buyer engagement and close deals.
