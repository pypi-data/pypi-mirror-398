# Principles, Not Recipes: The GTM Wizard Philosophy

## The Core Philosophy

> **GTM Wizard teaches you how to THINK about GTM problems, not what specific solution to implement.**

This is not a cookbook. It's a thinking partner.

## Why This Matters

### The Recipe Problem

Imagine someone shares their "perfect lead scoring model":
- 30 points for C-level titles
- 25 points for target industry
- 20 points for company size > 500
- Threshold: 65 points = qualified

**This recipe is dangerous if applied blindly.**

Why? Because it was built for:
- Their specific ICP
- Their specific ACV
- Their specific sales team capacity
- Their specific market conditions

Apply it to a different context and it will fail.

### The Principle Approach

Instead of the recipe, understand the principles:

1. **Lead scoring helps prioritize limited sales capacity**
   - If you have unlimited capacity, you don't need scoring
   - If you're capacity-constrained, scoring becomes critical

2. **Scoring factors should reflect actual conversion correlation**
   - Don't guess what matters; measure what actually converts
   - Role importance varies by product and motion

3. **Thresholds should match your capacity and volume**
   - High volume + low capacity = strict threshold
   - Low volume + high capacity = loose threshold

4. **Scoring models decay and need recalibration**
   - Markets change, your model should evolve
   - What worked last year might not work now

With these principles, you can BUILD YOUR OWN scoring model appropriate to your context.

## The GTM Wizard Approach

For every topic, we provide:

### 1. The Problem Space
- What problem are we solving?
- Why does this problem exist?
- Who has this problem?

### 2. The Principles
- What fundamental truths apply?
- What trade-offs exist?
- What factors influence decisions?

### 3. The Decision Framework
- What questions should you ask?
- How do you evaluate options?
- What are the key decision points?

### 4. Example Implementations
- How might this look in different contexts?
- What are the variations?
- What's the reasoning behind each variation?

### 5. Anti-Patterns
- What mistakes do people make?
- What should you avoid?
- Why do these fail?

## Example: Lead Qualification

### Recipe Approach (Wrong)
"Use a 4-gate system: Competitor → Industry → Role → Score"

### Principle Approach (Right)

**The Problem:** Not all leads are worth pursuing. Sales time is finite. You need a way to focus on leads most likely to convert.

**The Principles:**

1. **Qualification is about resource allocation**
   - More gates = more filtering = higher quality but lower volume
   - Fewer gates = less filtering = lower quality but higher volume
   - Match to your capacity and economics

2. **Gate order matters**
   - Put high-rejection, low-cost checks first
   - Put nuanced, expensive checks last
   - This minimizes total cost per qualified lead

3. **Each gate should have clear pass/fail criteria**
   - Ambiguous gates slow down the process
   - Clear criteria enable automation

4. **Fail-fast saves resources**
   - If 60% of leads fail at gate 1, you save cost on gates 2-4
   - Optimize gate order based on failure rates

**The Decision Framework:**

1. What's your current conversion rate from lead to customer?
2. What's your sales team capacity?
3. What's the cost of a sales touch vs. the value of a deal?
4. What factors actually predict conversion in YOUR business?

**Variations by Context:**

| Context | Qualification Approach |
|---------|----------------------|
| High volume, low ACV, SDR team | Simple score threshold, auto-route |
| Low volume, high ACV, AEs only | Multi-gate with human review |
| PLG with sales assist | Product usage signals trigger sales |
| Enterprise ABM | Account-level qualification, then contact |

**Anti-Patterns:**

- Building complex qualification with no volume (over-engineering)
- Using someone else's gates without validating they work for you
- Not measuring gate effectiveness (flying blind)
- Making gates so strict you starve the pipeline

## Thinking Tools We Provide

### 1. First Principles Questions
"Before building, answer these questions..."

These force you to understand your context before implementing.

### 2. Trade-Off Frameworks
"The trade-off here is X vs Y..."

These help you understand that every choice has consequences.

### 3. Context Adapters
"If your situation is A, then... If your situation is B, then..."

These help you apply principles to your specific context.

### 4. Validation Checks
"After implementing, verify that..."

These help you confirm your implementation is working.

### 5. Evolution Triggers
"Reconsider this approach when..."

These help you know when to change your approach.

## What We're NOT

### Not a Template Library
We don't give you templates to copy. Templates without understanding are dangerous.

### Not a Best Practices List
There are no universal best practices. There are only practices that work in specific contexts.

### Not a Tool Recommender
We don't say "use Tool X." We help you understand what capabilities you need, then you choose the tools.

### Not a Consulting Replacement
We provide thinking frameworks. Complex implementations still benefit from experienced humans.

---

## What We ARE

### A Thinking Partner
We help you reason through GTM problems systematically.

### A Principles Library
We capture the fundamental truths of GTM engineering.

### A Context Adapter
We help you apply principles to your specific situation.

### A Learning Accelerator
We help you build expertise faster by understanding the "why."

## The Ultimate Test

When you use GTM Wizard, you should come away with:

1. **Understanding** of why certain approaches work
2. **Frameworks** for making decisions
3. **Confidence** to adapt to your context
4. **Awareness** of trade-offs and risks

You should NOT come away with:
- Blind faith in a specific implementation
- Copy-paste solutions you don't understand
- Rigidity that prevents adaptation

---

## A Note on Examples

When we provide examples (like "here's how a 4-gate system might work"), remember:

1. **Examples illustrate principles** - they're not prescriptions
2. **Your implementation will differ** - that's expected and good
3. **The reasoning matters more than the specifics** - understand WHY
4. **Adapt freely** - you have permission to change everything
