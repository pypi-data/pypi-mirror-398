AwardsSearch Query Builder for USAspending.gov API.

This module provides a fluent interface for querying award data from the USAspending.gov API.
It wraps the following API endpoints:

1. **Primary Search Endpoint**: `/api/v2/search/spending_by_award/`
   - Returns detailed award information based on complex filter criteria
   - Supports pagination, sorting, and field selection
   - Full documentation: https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api/blob/102960f58c87e0a7b6490dc0317055cbfcaa9b7b/usaspending_api/api_contracts/contracts/v2/search/spending_by_award.md

2. **Count Endpoint**: `/api/v2/search/spending_by_award_count/`
   - Returns counts of awards grouped by type
   - Used internally by the count() method
   - Full documentation: https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api/blob/102960f58c87e0a7b6490dc0317055cbfcaa9b7b/usaspending_api/api_contracts/contracts/v2/search/spending_by_award_count.md

## Overview

The AwardsSearch class provides a chainable query builder pattern for constructing complex
award searches using the USAspending API. All filter methods return a new instance,
allowing for immutable query construction.

## Award Types

USAspending.gov categorizes awards into several types, each with specific codes:

Due to limitations in the API, you cannot mix different award type categories. Any query
must include one of the following award types:

- **Contracts**: Types A, B, C, D - Procurement contracts
- **IDVs**: Types IDV_A through IDV_E - Indefinite Delivery Vehicles
- **Grants**: Types 02, 03, 04, 05 - Grant awards
- **Loans**: Types 07, 08 - Loan awards
- **Direct Payments**: Types 06, 10 - Direct payment awards
- **Other**: Types 09, 11, -1 - Other assistance awards

## Basic Usage Examples

### Example 1: Search for Recent Contracts

```python
from usaspending import USASpendingClient

client = USASpendingClient()

# Find contracts from FY2024 for small businesses
contracts = (
    client.awards.search()
    .contracts()  # Filter to contract types only
    .fiscal_year(2024)
    .recipient_type_names("small_business")
    .order_by("Last Modified Date", "desc")
    .limit(100)
)

for contract in contracts:
    print(f"{contract.recipient.name}: ${contract.award_amount:,.2f} ${contract.period_of_performance.last_modified_date}")
```

### Example 2: Search Grants by Agency

```python
# Find all grants from the Department of Education in 2023
grants = (
    client.awards.search()
    .grants()  # Filter to grant types
    .agency("Department of Education")
    .fiscal_year(2023)
)

print(f"Total grants: {grants.count()}")

# Iterate through results (automatically handles pagination)
for grant in grants:
    print(f"{grant.award_id}: {grant.description}")
```

### Example 3: Complex Multi-Filter Search

```python
# Search for NASA-related contracts in California since 2020
from datetime import date

results = (
    client.awards.search()
    .contracts()
    .agency("National Aeronautics and Space Administration")
    .time_period("2020-03-01", date.today().isoformat())
    .place_of_performance_locations(
        {"state_code": "CA", "country_code": "USA"}
    )
    .award_amounts(
        {"lower_bound": 100000, "upper_bound": 10000000}
    )
    .order_by("Last Modified Date", "desc")
)

for award in results.page(1):
    print(f"{award.award_id}: {award.recipient.name}")
```


## Important Notes

The same filtering limitations and requirements that apply to the USAspending.gov API also apply here:

1. **Required Award Type Filter**: Every query must include a filter for `award_type_codes`.
    Use the `.award_type_codes()` method or convenience methods like `.contracts()`, `.grants()`, `.loans()`, `.idvs()`, `.direct_payments()`, or `.other_assistance()`
    to set the award type category.

2. **Single Category Restriction**: You cannot mix different award type categories
   (e.g., contracts and grants) in a single query. Use separate queries for each.

3. **Automatic Pagination**: Iterating over results automatically handles pagination.
   Use `limit()` to control returned result size.

        Filter by one or more award type codes.

        **This filter is required** - the API requires at least one award type code.

        Award type codes include:
        - Contracts: A, B, C, D
        - IDVs: IDV_A, IDV_B, IDV_B_A, IDV_B_B, IDV_B_C, IDV_C, IDV_D, IDV_E
        - Grants: 02, 03, 04, 05
        - Loans: 07, 08
        - Direct Payments: 06, 10
        - Other: 09, 11, -1

        Args:
            *award_codes: A sequence of award type codes.

        Returns:
            AwardsSearch: A new instance with the award type filter applied.

                different award type categories (e.g., contracts and grants
