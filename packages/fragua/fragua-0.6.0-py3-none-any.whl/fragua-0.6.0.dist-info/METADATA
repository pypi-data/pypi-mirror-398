# Fragua

**Fragua** is a lightweight, modular Python library designed to model, configure, and orchestrate **ETL / ELT workflows** through explicit environments and well-defined execution boundaries.

Instead of centering the design around individual agents, Fragua treats the **Environment** as the primary abstraction: a self-contained execution context that owns configuration, state, components, and data artifacts.

---

## What is Fragua?

Fragua provides an abstraction layer for data integration workflows where **everything happens inside an Environment**.

An `Environment` represents a fully isolated workspace that defines:

- Which agents exist
- Which components they can use
- Where data is stored
- How operations are logged and traced

Agents such as extractors, transformers, and loaders do not operate independently; they are **created, configured, and executed within an Environment**, which guarantees consistency, traceability, and predictable behavior.

---

## The Environment as the Core Concept

The **Environment** is the central coordinator of the system.

It is responsible for:

- Managing the lifecycle of agents.
- Hosting registries for:
  - `params`
  - `functions`
  - `styles`
- Providing access to a shared **Warehouse**.
- Enforcing execution context, configuration rules, and boundaries.
- Exposing structured summaries of the entire runtime state.

This approach allows multiple environments to coexist independently, each one representing a distinct pipeline, experiment, or execution context.

---

## Agents as Environment-Orchestrated Components

Within an Environment, Fragua supports three agent roles:

- **Extractor** — Retrieves data from external sources.
- **Transformer** — Applies transformations or enrichment logic.
- **Loader** — Persists or delivers processed data.

Agents are **not global actors**. They:

- Are instantiated by the Environment
- Resolve styles, params, and functions exclusively via registries
- Interact with data only through the Environment’s Warehouse
- Follow a standardized execution workflow

This ensures that agents remain stateless orchestrators rather than owners of configuration or data.

---

## Component Registries and Architecture

Fragua uses a layered component model to ensure consistency and extensibility:

- **FraguaComponent** — Base abstraction for all registrable elements.
- **FraguaSet** — Generic container responsible for CRUD operations, validation, and summaries.
- **FraguaRegistry** — Groups related `FraguaSet` instances by action and component type.

All components (`styles`, `functions`, `params`, `agents`) are registered and resolved through these layers, eliminating implicit coupling and duplicated logic.

---

## Storage, Warehouse, and Traceability

Each Environment owns a **Warehouse**, which acts as the single source of truth for pipeline artifacts.

Storage management provides:

- Controlled add, get, delete, rename, and copy operations
- Full movement logging with timestamps
- Undo support for destructive actions
- Metadata-based search and snapshotting

---

## Key Features

- Environment-centric workflow orchestration.
- Explicit isolation between pipelines.
- Standardized agent execution model.
- Component-based architecture.
- Centralized storage and traceability.
- Rich `summary()` methods with improved docstrings.
- Built-in logging and operational metadata.
