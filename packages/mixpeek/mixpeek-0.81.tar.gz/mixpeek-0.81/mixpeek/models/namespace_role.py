    Role assigned to a user when scoped to a namespace.  Namespace roles define the default permissions a user has within a specific namespace. These roles inherit from organization roles but provide namespace-level isolation.  Role hierarchy (most to least privileged):     OWNER: Full control over the namespace including deletion.         - Can perform all operations within the namespace         - Can manage all users and their namespace permissions         - Can delete the namespace entirely         - Can modify namespace infrastructure settings         - Typically assigned to the user who created the namespace      ADMIN: Administrative access without deletion capability.         - Can perform all data and retrieval operations         - Can manage namespace-level user permissions (except owner)         - Can create/modify/delete clusters and infrastructure         - Cannot delete the namespace itself         - Best for: Team leads, namespace administrators      MEMBER: Standard user access for day-to-day operations.         - Can create, read, update, and delete data within the namespace         - Can execute retrievers and trigger jobs         - Can create retrievers and manage their own resources         - Cannot manage user permissions or infrastructure settings         - Best for: Data engineers, developers, analysts      VIEWER: Read-only access for monitoring and analytics.         - Can view all data and execute retrievers         - Cannot create, modify, or delete any resources         - Cannot trigger ingestion jobs or processing pipelines         - Best for: Business users, auditors, observers  Examples:     - Assign OWNER to namespace creator     - Assign ADMIN to team leads managing shared namespaces     - Assign MEMBER to developers and data engineers     - Assign VIEWER to analysts and business stakeholders
