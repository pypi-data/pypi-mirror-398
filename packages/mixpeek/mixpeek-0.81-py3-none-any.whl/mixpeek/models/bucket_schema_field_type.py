    Supported data types for bucket schema fields.  Types fall into two categories:  1. Metadata Types (JSON types):    - Stored as object metadata    - Standard JSON-compatible types    - Not processed by extractors (unless explicitly mapped)  2. File Types:    - Stored as blobs (files)    - Processed by extractors    - Require actual file content (URL or base64)  **GIF Special Handling**:     GIF files can be declared as either IMAGE or VIDEO type:      - As IMAGE: GIF is embedded as a single static image (first frame)     - As VIDEO: GIF is decomposed frame-by-frame with embeddings per frame      The multimodal extractor detects GIFs via MIME type (image/gif) and routes     them based on your schema declaration. Use VIDEO for animated GIFs where     frame-level search is needed, IMAGE for static/thumbnail use cases.
