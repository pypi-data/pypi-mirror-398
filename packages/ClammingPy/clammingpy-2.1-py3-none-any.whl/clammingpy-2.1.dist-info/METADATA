# ClammingPy Description

## Overview

> ClammingPy is a Light Python-API Documentation in Markdown and accessible HTML

### Typical use

You have a Python API you documented with docstrings, and you want to share documentation in either Markdown or HTML.
ClammingPy is the documentation generator you may need: it is generating Markdown or HTML from the docstrings within the source code of any Python library.

> ClammingPy generates HTML-5 with a high level of WCAG 2.1 conformity.

### Features

Python modules are usually documented using docstrings. They typically use plain text markup formats such as reStructuredText (reST, the markup used for writing the official Python documentation) and/or Markdown.
`ClammingPy` is a Python, free, open-source, self-hosted library to export a Python class or module into a Markdown and/or HTML files, for documentation purpose. Contrariwise to other documentation tools, docstrings are analyzed with **flexibility rather than completeness...**

> Both ReST and Epydoc field styles are supported. It means that either ':field:' or '@field:' can be used indifferently, with upper- or lower- cases.

Two very useful reST non-standard field items can also be used in the docstrings: `:example:` and `:code:`. 
Finally, some variants in field names are supported:

- `:return:` or `:returns:` are both interpreted the same way;
- `:raise:` or `:raises:` or `:catch:` or `:except:` are all interpreted the same way.


### Main advantages

- easily customizable: it's a pure python library in Object-Oriented Programming
- open-source: easily add new features and functionalities 
- scalable: no limit to support numerous modules
- inclusive: the documentation is highly WCAG 2.1 compliant


## Install ClammingPy

Get it here: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/clamming/>.

ClammingPy requires Whakerexa to be installed; it can be downloaded from: <https://whakerexa.sourceforge.io>.

### From pypi

```bash
> python -m pip install ClammingPy
```

### From the repo:

Download the repository and unpack it. ClammingPy tool includes the following folders and files:

1. `clamming`: the source code of `ClammingPy` library
2. `docs`: the documentation of clamming library in HTML
3. `tests`: unittest of `Clamming` library
4. `sample`: a sample class `Vehicle` to illustrate `clamming` use
5. `makedoc.py`: create the ClammingPy documentation, using `clamming` library
6. `etc`: etcetera!

### From the package:

Install it in your python environment from the local wheel with:

```bash
> python -m pip install dist/<clamming.whl>
```


## Quick start

### Documenting a single class

The `sample` folder contains a Python class example and the simplest solution to get access to the documentation either in Markdown or HTML. The `Vehicle` class is illustrating the supported format and its flexibility. Try it with:

```bash
> cd sample
> python makedoc_vehicle.py > vehicle.html
> python makedoc_vehicle.py --md > vehicle.md
```

or with the main program:
```bash
> python main.py -c Vehicle -m sample.vehicle
> python main.py -c Vehicle -m sample.vehicle --md
```

In the same way, the documentation of any Python class can be extracted with, for example:

```bash
> python main.py -c TestCase -m unittest --md
> python main.py -c BaseHTTPRequestHandler -m http.server --md
```

When using the `ClammingPy` library directly, the documented files can be obtained with the following Python code:

```python
>>> import clamming
>>> import Vehicle  # Or any other Python class to be documented
>>> parser = clamming.ClammingClassParser(Vehicle)
>>> clams = clamming.ClamsClass(parser)
>>> print(clams.html())
>>> print(clams.markdown())
```

### Documenting all classes of a module

Below are two examples with the main program:
```bash
> python main.py -m clamming > clamming.html
> python main.py -m http.server --md | grep "### Class "
### Class `HTTPServer`
### Class `ThreadingHTTPServer`
### Class `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`
### Class `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`
### Class `CGIHTTPRequestHandler`
```

The following Python code allows to generate the documentation of `clamming`
module in Mardown format or in HTML format as a standalone content:

```python
>>> import clamming
>>> clams_pack = clamming.ClamsPack(clamming)
>>> print(clams_pack.markdown())
>>> print(clams_pack.html())
```

Here is a summary of the main steps to generate an HTML documentation, in a bunch of HTML files:

```python
>> > import clamming
>> >  # Options for HTML exportation
>> > html_export = clamming.ExportOptions()
>> > html_export.software = 'ClammingPy ' + clamming.__version__
>> >  # Create an HTML page for each class of the module
>> > clams_pack = clamming.ClamsPack(clamming)
>> > clams_pack.html_export_clams("docs", html_export)
```

### Documenting all classes of a list of modules

There is an all-in-one function to generate the HTML documentation of a list of packages. It requires to define the followings:

1. The list of ClamsPack instances of the modules to be documented;
2. The HTMLDocExport allowing to fix the HTML options for files exportation.

```python
>> > import clamming
>> >  # List of modules to be documented.
>> > packages = list()
>> > packages.append(clamming)
>> >  # Options for HTML exportation
>> > html_export = clamming.ExportOptions()
>> > html_export.wexa_statics = '../Whakerexa-1.0/wexa_statics'
>> > html_export.software = 'ClammingPy ' + clamming.__version__
>> >  # Export documentation to HTML files into the "docs" folder.
>> > m = clamming.ClamsModules(packages)
>> > m.html_export_packages("docs", html_export)
>> >  # Export documentation to Markdown files into the "docs" folder.
>> > m.markdown_export_packages("docs")
```

See `makedoc.py` Python script for details.

> See the ClammingPy documentation in `docs` folder for extended usages.

## Browse the documentation

Documentation is available in the `docs` folder and inline.
For the local use, download and unpack Whakerexa >= 2.0 into the `docs` folder.
