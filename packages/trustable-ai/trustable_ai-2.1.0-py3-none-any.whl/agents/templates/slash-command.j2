# {{ agent_name|replace('-', ' ')|title }} Agent Invocation

Read the agent definition from `.claude/agents/{{ agent_name }}.md` and invoke it as a separate agent using the Task tool.

**Important:** This agent should be spawned with:
- Model: {{ model }}
- Fresh context window
- Extended thinking enabled (the agent definition includes this guidance)

## Instructions

1. Read the full agent definition from `.claude/agents/{{ agent_name }}.md`
2. Combine it with the user's specific request
3. Invoke using the Task tool with `model="{{ model_param }}"` and `subagent_type="general-purpose"`
4. The agent will execute in a fresh context window with its own token budget
5. Return the agent's analysis to the user

Pass the user's request to the {{ agent_name|replace('-', ' ')|title }} agent now.
