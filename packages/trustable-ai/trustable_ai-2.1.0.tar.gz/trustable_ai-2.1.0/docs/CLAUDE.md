# Documentation

## Purpose

Solves **knowledge loss** and **repeated mistakes** by documenting architecture decisions, design rationale, and lessons learned.

Without documentation:
- New developers waste weeks rediscovering system design
- Same mistakes repeated because lessons not captured
- Architecture decisions lost when developers leave
- "Why was it built this way?" questions unanswerable

Documentation preserves institutional knowledge, reduces onboarding time, and prevents regression to solved problems.

## Documentation Types

- **Architecture Decisions**: Why components are structured this way
- **Design Rationale**: Problems that led to current design
- **API Documentation**: How to use framework components
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and solutions
- **Migration Guides**: Upgrading between versions

All documentation focuses on the **why** (rationale) not just the **what** (features).
