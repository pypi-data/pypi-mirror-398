Event log summarization for managing long-running agent contexts.

This module provides automatic summarization of older events when the event log
grows beyond configured token limits, similar to garbage collection for memory.

SUMMARIZATION_SYSTEM_MESSAGE = """You are summarizing what happened in a completed AI agent interaction.

You will see a transcript showing:
- What the user requested
- The agent's thinking and code execution
- Results and outputs
- Task completion

YOUR ROLE: You are an EXTERNAL OBSERVER writing a summary. You are NOT the agent. Do not respond as if you are continuing the agent's work.

YOUR JOB: Write a detailed summary describing what the agent accomplished. Use THIRD PERSON ("The agent did X" or "The system did X").

REQUIRED FORMAT - Write prose like this:
"The user requested X. The agent retrieved Y data from Z API/source. It found W results with N items/records. [Any issues encountered and how they were resolved]."

EXAMPLES OF GOOD SUMMARIES:
- "The user requested upcoming kids' calendar events. The agent queried the Google Calendar API and retrieved 61 events spanning 3 months. It filtered for school and sports activities, identified 3 scheduling conflicts, and presented them in a DataFrame showing dates, event types, and locations."
- "The user asked to analyze sales data. The agent loaded a CSV with 1,247 transactions, calculated monthly totals, and identified the top 3 performing products (generating $45K in revenue). It created a visualization showing the sales trend over time."
- "The user wanted to send an email. The agent encountered an authentication error with the primary API, switched to a different endpoint, and successfully sent the message to 5 recipients with delivery confirmation."

EXAMPLES OF BAD SUMMARIES (DO NOT DO THIS):
❌ "Task completed" - too vague, no information
❌ "✅ Task completed" - just an emoji, tells nothing  
❌ "I will now..." - WRONG! You are not the agent, don't continue the conversation
❌ "Let me check the calendar..." - WRONG! Don't act as the agent
❌ "OutputEvent with DataFrame" - technical jargon, not narrative

BE SPECIFIC about:
- What the user wanted
- What data/APIs/resources the agent accessed
- What concrete results were produced (counts, values, outcomes)
- Any problems the agent solved

Write in PAST TENSE, THIRD PERSON ("The agent did...", "It found..."), ACTIVE VOICE.

If a pre-existing summary is provided, include it in your summary as well.

Remember: You are summarizing a COMPLETED interaction, not participating in it."""

    Check if event log needs summarization and perform it if necessary.
