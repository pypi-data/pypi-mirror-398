"""Action handlers module for pygitzen.

This module contains action handlers that coordinate between UI and services.
Action handlers are responsible for:
- Checking UI state (focus, selection)
- Calling appropriate services
- Updating UI (notifications, refresh)
- Handling user feedback

Unlike services, handlers have UI dependencies and are aware of the app context.
