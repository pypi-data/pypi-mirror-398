class MasterView(View):  # pylint: disable=too-many-public-methods
    """
    Base class for "master" views.

    Master views typically map to a table in a DB, though not always.
    They essentially are a set of CRUD views for a certain type of
    data record.

    Many attributes may be overridden in subclass.  For instance to
    define :attr:`model_class`::

       from wuttaweb.views import MasterView
       from wuttjamaican.db.model import Person

       class MyPersonView(MasterView):
           model_class = Person

       def includeme(config):
           MyPersonView.defaults(config)

    .. note::

       Many of these attributes will only exist if they have been
       explicitly defined in a subclass.  There are corresponding
       ``get_xxx()`` methods which should be used instead of accessing
       these attributes directly.

    .. attribute:: model_class

       Optional reference to a :term:`data model` class.  While not
       strictly required, most views will set this to a SQLAlchemy
       mapped class,
       e.g. :class:`~wuttjamaican:wuttjamaican.db.model.base.Person`.

       The base logic should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_model_class()`.

    .. attribute:: model_name

       Optional override for the view's data model name,
       e.g. ``'WuttaWidget'``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_model_name()`.

    .. attribute:: model_name_normalized

       Optional override for the view's "normalized" data model name,
       e.g. ``'wutta_widget'``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_model_name_normalized()`.

    .. attribute:: model_title

       Optional override for the view's "humanized" (singular) model
       title, e.g. ``"Wutta Widget"``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_model_title()`.

    .. attribute:: model_title_plural

       Optional override for the view's "humanized" (plural) model
       title, e.g. ``"Wutta Widgets"``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_model_title_plural()`.

    .. attribute:: model_key

       Optional override for the view's "model key" - e.g. ``'id'``
       (string for simple case) or composite key such as
       ``('id_field', 'name_field')``.

       If :attr:`model_class` is set to a SQLAlchemy mapped class, the
       model key can be determined automatically.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_model_key()`.

    .. attribute:: grid_key

       Optional override for the view's grid key, e.g. ``'widgets'``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_grid_key()`.

    .. attribute:: config_title

       Optional override for the view's "config" title, e.g. ``"Wutta
       Widgets"`` (to be displayed as **Configure Wutta Widgets**).

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_config_title()`.

    .. attribute:: route_prefix

       Optional override for the view's route prefix,
       e.g. ``'wutta_widgets'``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_route_prefix()`.

    .. attribute:: permission_prefix

       Optional override for the view's permission prefix,
       e.g. ``'wutta_widgets'``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_permission_prefix()`.

    .. attribute:: url_prefix

       Optional override for the view's URL prefix,
       e.g. ``'/widgets'``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_url_prefix()`.

    .. attribute:: template_prefix

       Optional override for the view's template prefix,
       e.g. ``'/widgets'``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_template_prefix()`.

    .. attribute:: listable

       Boolean indicating whether the view model supports "listing" -
       i.e. it should have an :meth:`index()` view.  Default value is
       ``True``.

    .. attribute:: has_grid

       Boolean indicating whether the :meth:`index()` view should
       include a grid.  Default value is ``True``.

    .. attribute:: grid_columns

       List of columns for the :meth:`index()` view grid.

       This is optional; see also :meth:`get_grid_columns()`.

    .. attribute:: checkable

       Boolean indicating whether the grid should expose per-row
       checkboxes.  This is passed along to set
       :attr:`~wuttaweb.grids.base.Grid.checkable` on the grid.

    .. method:: grid_row_class(obj, data, i)

       This method is *not* defined on the ``MasterView`` base class;
       however if a subclass defines it then it will be automatically
       used to provide :attr:`~wuttaweb.grids.base.Grid.row_class` for
       the main :meth:`index()` grid.

       For more info see
       :meth:`~wuttaweb.grids.base.Grid.get_row_class()`.

    .. attribute:: filterable

       Boolean indicating whether the grid for the :meth:`index()`
       view should allow filtering of data.  Default is ``True``.

       :attr:`~wuttaweb.grids.base.Grid.filterable` flag.

    .. attribute:: filter_defaults

       Optional dict of default filter state.

       This is used by :meth:`make_model_grid()` to set the grid's

       Only relevant if :attr:`filterable` is true.

    .. attribute:: sortable

       Boolean indicating whether the grid for the :meth:`index()`
       view should allow sorting of data.  Default is ``True``.

       This is used by :meth:`make_model_grid()` to set the grid's
       :attr:`~wuttaweb.grids.base.Grid.sortable` flag.

       See also :attr:`sort_on_backend` and :attr:`sort_defaults`.

    .. attribute:: sort_on_backend

       Boolean indicating whether the grid data for the
       :meth:`index()` view should be sorted on the backend.  Default
       is ``True``.

       This is used by :meth:`make_model_grid()` to set the grid's
       :attr:`~wuttaweb.grids.base.Grid.sort_on_backend` flag.

       Only relevant if :attr:`sortable` is true.

    .. attribute:: sort_defaults

       Optional list of default sorting info.  Applicable for both
       frontend and backend sorting.

       This is used by :meth:`make_model_grid()` to set the grid's
       :attr:`~wuttaweb.grids.base.Grid.sort_defaults`.

       Only relevant if :attr:`sortable` is true.

    .. attribute:: paginated

       Boolean indicating whether the grid data for the
       :meth:`index()` view should be paginated.  Default is ``True``.

       This is used by :meth:`make_model_grid()` to set the grid's
       :attr:`~wuttaweb.grids.base.Grid.paginated` flag.

    .. attribute:: paginate_on_backend

       Boolean indicating whether the grid data for the
       :meth:`index()` view should be paginated on the backend.
       Default is ``True``.

       This is used by :meth:`make_model_grid()` to set the grid's
       :attr:`~wuttaweb.grids.base.Grid.paginate_on_backend` flag.

    .. attribute:: creatable

       Boolean indicating whether the view model supports "creating" -
       i.e. it should have a :meth:`create()` view.  Default value is
       ``True``.

    .. attribute:: viewable

       Boolean indicating whether the view model supports "viewing" -
       i.e. it should have a :meth:`view()` view.  Default value is
       ``True``.

    .. attribute:: editable

       Boolean indicating whether the view model supports "editing" -
       i.e. it should have an :meth:`edit()` view.  Default value is
       ``True``.

       See also :meth:`is_editable()`.

    .. attribute:: deletable

       Boolean indicating whether the view model supports "deleting" -
       i.e. it should have a :meth:`delete()` view.  Default value is
       ``True``.

       See also :meth:`is_deletable()`.

    .. attribute:: deletable_bulk

       Boolean indicating whether the view model supports "bulk
       deleting" - i.e. it should have a :meth:`delete_bulk()` view.
       Default value is ``False``.

       See also :attr:`deletable_bulk_quick`.

    .. attribute:: deletable_bulk_quick

       Boolean indicating whether the view model supports "quick" bulk
       deleting, i.e. the operation is reliably quick enough that it
       should happen *synchronously* with no progress indicator.

       Default is ``False`` in which case a progress indicator is
       shown while the bulk deletion is performed.

       Only relevant if :attr:`deletable_bulk` is true.

    .. attribute:: form_fields

       List of fields for the model form.

       This is optional; see also :meth:`get_form_fields()`.

    .. attribute:: has_autocomplete

       Boolean indicating whether the view model supports
       "autocomplete" - i.e. it should have an :meth:`autocomplete()`
       view.  Default is ``False``.

    .. attribute:: downloadable

       Boolean indicating whether the view model supports
       "downloading" - i.e. it should have a :meth:`download()` view.
       Default is ``False``.

    .. attribute:: executable

       Boolean indicating whether the view model supports "executing"
       - i.e. it should have an :meth:`execute()` view.  Default is
       ``False``.

    .. attribute:: configurable

       Boolean indicating whether the master view supports

       Default value is ``False``.

    .. attribute:: version_grid_columns

       List of columns for the :meth:`view_versions()` view grid.

       This is optional; see also :meth:`get_version_grid_columns()`.

    **ROW FEATURES**

    .. attribute:: has_rows

       Whether the model has "child rows" which should also be
       displayed when viewing model records.  For instance when
       viewing a :term:`batch` you want to see both the batch header
       as well as its row data.

       This the "master switch" for all row features; if this is turned
       on then many other things kick in.

       See also :attr:`row_model_class`.

    .. attribute:: row_model_class

       Reference to the :term:`data model` class for the child rows.

       Subclass should define this if :attr:`has_rows` is true.

       View logic should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_row_model_class()`.

    .. attribute:: row_model_name

       Optional override for the view's row model name,
       e.g. ``'WuttaWidget'``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_row_model_name()`.

    .. attribute:: row_model_title

       Optional override for the view's "humanized" (singular) row
       model title, e.g. ``"Wutta Widget"``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_row_model_title()`.

    .. attribute:: row_model_title_plural

       Optional override for the view's "humanized" (plural) row model
       title, e.g. ``"Wutta Widgets"``.

       Code should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_row_model_title_plural()`.

    .. attribute:: rows_title

       Display title for the rows grid.

       The base logic should not access this directly but instead call
       :meth:`get_rows_title()`.

    .. attribute:: row_grid_columns

       List of columns for the row grid.

       This is optional; see also :meth:`get_row_grid_columns()`.

       This is optional; see also :meth:`get_row_grid_columns()`.

    .. attribute:: rows_viewable

       Boolean indicating whether the row model supports "viewing" -
       i.e. the row grid should have a "View" action.  Default value
       is ``False``.

       (For now) If you enable this, you must also override
       :meth:`get_row_action_url_view()`.

       .. note::
          This eventually will cause there to be a ``row_view`` route
          to be configured as well.

    .. attribute:: row_form_fields

       List of fields for the row model form.

       This is optional; see also :meth:`get_row_form_fields()`.

    .. attribute:: rows_creatable

       Boolean indicating whether the row model supports "creating" -
       i.e. a route should be defined for :meth:`create_row()`.
       Default value is ``False``.

        .. warning::

           If you are defining this method for a subclass, please note
           this point regarding the 404 "not found" logic.

           It is *not* enough to simply *return* this 404 response,
           you must explicitly *raise* the error.  For instance::

              def get_instance(self, **kwargs):
