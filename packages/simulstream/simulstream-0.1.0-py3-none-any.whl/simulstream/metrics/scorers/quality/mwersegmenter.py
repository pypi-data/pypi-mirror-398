class MWERSegmenterBasedQualityScorer(QualityScorer):
    """
    Abstract base class for scorers that require aligned system outputs and references through
    MWER Segmenter alignment.

    This class wraps a quality scorer and applies the MWER Segmenter alignment by `"Effects of
    automatic alignment on speech translation metrics"
    <https://aclanthology.org/2025.iwslt-1.7/>`_ to hypotheses before scoring.

    Subclasses must implement :meth:`_do_score`, which receives
    :class:`ResegmentedQualityScoringSample` instances, where output and references are aligned.

    Example:
        >>> class CustomQualityScorer(MWERSegmenterBasedQualityScorer):
        ...     def _do_score(self, samples):
        ...         # Compute a custom quality score
