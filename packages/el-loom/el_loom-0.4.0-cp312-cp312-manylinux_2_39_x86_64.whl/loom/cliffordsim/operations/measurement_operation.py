    Creates a measurement operation for a single qubit.

    needs to be specified with reg_name and (bit_order or bit_id).

    bit_id: Optional[str]
        The bit ID of the bit within the classical register to write the measurement

    basis: str
        The basis of the measurement. Default is Z.
