# Instructions

Use this file to define rollback procedures for ScreenPilot. Rollbacks behave like transitions, but are triggered in rollback mode when exceptions occur.

# Example
```python
@rollback("State1", "State2")
def perform_rollback():
    # Perform necessary actions to revert from State1 to State2
    # Optionally, save a screenshot or log information
    raise RollbackCompleted()
```
