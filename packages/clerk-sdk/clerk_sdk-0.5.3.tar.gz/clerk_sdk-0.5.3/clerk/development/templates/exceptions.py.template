# Instructions

Define custom exceptions for ScreenPilot here.
- Any exception will be caught by ScreenPilot's main loop, activating rollback mode and course correction.
- Raise subclasses of BusinessException to indicate business process conditions that should not trigger rollbacks.

# Example
```python
class CustomError(BusinessException):
    pass
```
