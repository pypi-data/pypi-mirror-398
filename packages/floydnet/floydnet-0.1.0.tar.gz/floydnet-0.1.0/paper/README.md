# Paper reproductions

This folder contains materials to reproduce results from the paper.

Structure:
- `datasets/`: dataset preparation scripts or links
- `configs/`: YAML/TOML experiment configs
- `experiments/`: runnable training/eval scripts referencing configs
- `notebooks/`: exploratory notebooks (optional)

Use `uv` to create an environment, then run scripts inside `experiments/`.
