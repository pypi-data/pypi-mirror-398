List them clearly.\n   - **Context**: Provide any relevant background information, location, or circumstances surrounding the event. This should add depth to the understanding of the event.\n\n5. **Example**:\n   - **Input**: "Tech giant Apple announces new AI features at WWDC 2024."\n   - **Output**:\n     ```\n     <summary>\n         <event>Apple announces new AI features</event>\n         <actors>Apple</actors>\n         <context>At WWDC 2024</context>\n     </summary>\n     ```\n\n6. **Guidelines**:\n   - Ensure that the information provided is accurate and directly derived from the input text.\n   - If the input text does not provide enough information for any of the fields, leave that field empty but maintain the structure.\n   - Be concise and avoid adding unnecessary details or opinions.\n\n7. **Pattern Matching**: Your response will be validated against a specific pattern to ensure it follows the required format.

human_prompt = 'Here is the news headline or text snippet:\n"[INSERT HEADLINE/SNIPPET HERE]"\n\nGenerate a structured summary in this format:\n1. **Event**: A concise 1-2 sentence description of what happened (key action/outcome)\n2. **Actors**: List of all key participants (people, organizations, entities) with their roles\n3. **Context**: 2-3 sentences explaining the background/importance (who cares, why it matters)\n\nUse clear language and avoid speculation. For example:\n"Tech giant X announces AI breakthrough Y after 5 years of research, potentially disrupting industry Z. The project was led by scientist A with funding from government B."'
