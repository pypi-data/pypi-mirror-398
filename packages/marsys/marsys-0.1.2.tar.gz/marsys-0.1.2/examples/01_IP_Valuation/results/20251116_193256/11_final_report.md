- Competitive product benchmarking needed
- Willingness-to-pay data required
- Best used for incremental feature patents

**Method 3: Cost Savings/Avoidance**
- Would require design-around cost estimates
- Patent invalidation cost scenarios needed
- Complex to model with precision
- Best used for defensive patent valuations

**Rationale for Selected Method:**
- Comparable royalty approach preferred when industry benchmarks available
- Strong patent quality metrics support reliance on market rates
- Transparent, defensible methodology
- Aligns with Georgia-Pacific factors and IP valuation standards

| **Patent Maturity Risk** | +3.0% | Technology proven (TRL 8); low obsolescence risk |
| **Portfolio Dependency Risk** | +2.0% | Part of Samsung's massive patent portfolio; low single-patent dependency |
| **Litigation Risk** | +3.0% | No current disputes; Samsung's legal strength mitigates; wireless field has moderate litigation frequency |
| **TOTAL RISK PREMIUM** | **+8.0%** | Reflects low overall risk profile for mature commercialized technology |

**Adjusted Discount Rate:**
```
Discount Rate = 4.81% + 8.0% = 12.81%
```

## 13. RECOMMENDATIONS

### 13.1 Strategic IP Management Recommendations

**For Samsung (Assignee):**

1. **Maintain Active Patent Portfolio**
   - Continue annual maintenance fee payments through 2041
   - Monitor for invalidation challenges; prepare defensive responses
   - Consider selective filing of continuation applications to update claims
   - **Rationale:** 86/100 strength score justifies ongoing investment

2. **Aggressive Licensing Strategy**
   - Leverage Porsche precedent to expand automotive OEM licensing
   - Target consumer electronics manufacturers in Qi space
   - Explore smart home and IoT device OEM partnerships
   - Document licensing agreements to support future enforcement
   - **Rationale:** Base case valuation shows $340K potential from moderate licensing; bull case exceeds $1.1M with multiple partnerships

3. **Enforcement Readiness**
   - Monitor market for potential infringement (especially consumer charging pads)
   - Build detailed claim construction evidence for litigation support
   - Coordinate with international patent family for global enforcement
   - Consider ITC import-based enforcement for consumer products
   - **Rationale:** High blocking potential (300 citations) merits enforcement consideration; low litigation risk allows offensive posture

4. **Market Intelligence Gathering**
   - Track competitor product announcements in wireless charging space
   - Monitor new patent filings potentially infringing key claims
   - Assess design-around viability in target markets
   - Evaluate emerging technology threats (far-field RF, ultrasonic, etc.)
   - **Rationale:** 16-year patent life requires active management; early intervention can prevent market entrenchment of alternatives

### 13.2 Valuation Usage Recommendations

**For Licensing Negotiations:**
- **Use Base Case ($340K) as starting point** for licensing discussions
- Adjust upward if counterparty demonstrates strong commercial interest
- Account for transaction certainty (base case reflects moderate certainty)
- Consider multi-year licensing agreements to provide revenue smoothing
- **Royalty Rate Floor:** 3% (reflects comparable license range)

**For M&A/Acquisition Decisions:**
