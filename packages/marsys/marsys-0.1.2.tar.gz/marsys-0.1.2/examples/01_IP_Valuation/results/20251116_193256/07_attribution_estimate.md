---

## Attribution Methodology

### Primary Method: Comparable License Royalty Analysis

**Formula:**  
IP_Contribution = Royalty_Rate / Profit_Margin

**Calculation:**
- Technology License Range: 1-6%
- Mid-Range Recommendation: 2-4%
- Selected Royalty Rate: **3%** (mid-point of recommended range)
- Profit Margin: **6.35%**

**Result:**  
IP_Contribution = 0.03 / 0.0635 = **0.4724 (47.24%)**

**Validation:**
- Result falls within acceptable range (5-90%)
- Adjusted to: **0.47 (47%)**

## Supporting Analysis

### 25% Rule of Thumb Validation

The classic "25% rule" suggests IP should receive approximately 25% of profits attributable to the technology. Our calculated 47% exceeds this baseline, which is justified by:

1. **Exceptional Patent Strength (86/100)**
   - Well above industry average
   - Indicates superior claim construction and scope

2. **HIGH Blocking Potential**
   - 300 forward citations demonstrate significant industry reliance
   - Creates strong negotiating position for licensing

3. **STRONG & BROAD Claims**
   - 2 independent claims provide multiple enforcement vectors
   - Broad claim breadth covers wider market applications

4. **Portfolio Context: Portfolio Management**
   - This patent is part of Samsung's strategic wireless charging portfolio
   - Key technology in rapidly growing $1B+ wireless charging market

### Industry Benchmark Alignment

**Wireless Charging Patent Licensing Context:**
- Qi standard patent pools actively licensing wireless charging technology
- Industry seeing significant licensing activity in wireless charging domain
- Technology license rates for wireless charging: 1-6% (per financial benchmarks)
- Selected 3% rate represents conservative mid-point for high-quality patents

**Citations & References:**
- Qi Wireless Charging Patent Leaders (LexisNexis IP, 2024)
- Via LA wireless charging patent pool licensing structures
- Wireless charging market projected to exceed $1B in royalty potential
- Industry standard royalty calculations for smartphone technology

## Justification for 47% Contribution

### Factors Supporting Higher Attribution:

1. **Superior Patent Quality**
   - Strength score 86 vs. typical 60-70 range
   - STRONG claims with BROAD scope

2. **Market Position**
   - 300 forward citations = significant industry adoption
   - HIGH blocking potential limits competitor alternatives

3. **Technology Criticality**
   - Wireless charging becoming standard smartphone feature
   - Patent covers fundamental aspects of technology implementation

4. **Profit Margin Context**
   - Lower profit margin (6.35%) appropriately increases IP share
   - Formula correctly attributes larger percentage when margins are thin

### Conservative Adjustments Applied:

- Used mid-range 3% royalty rate (not upper 6%)
- Applied standard formula without multipliers
- Rounded down from 47.24% to 47%

---

## Alternative Method Considerations

### Method 2: Smallest Salable Unit (SSU)
**Not Applied** - Wireless charging component value allocation would require:
- Detailed bill of materials for specific Samsung products
- Component-level cost breakdown
- Patent-to-component mapping specific to this patent

### Method 3: Feature Value Analysis
**Not Applied** - Would require:
- Detailed claim-by-claim feature analysis
- Competitive product feature benchmarking
- Customer willingness-to-pay data for specific features

**Rationale:** Comparable license royalty method is preferred when industry benchmark data is available and patent quality metrics are strong.

## Risk Factors & Assumptions

### Key Assumptions:
1. 3% royalty rate is representative of high-quality wireless charging patents
2. Profit margin of 6.35% accurately reflects product economics
3. Portfolio management context allows individual patent attribution
4. Patent maintains strength through 10-year projection period

### Sensitivity Analysis:

| Royalty Rate | Profit Margin | IP Contribution |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 2% (Low)     | 6.35%         | 31.5%           |
| 3% (Base)    | 6.35%         | 47.2%           |
| 4% (High)    | 6.35%         | 63.0%           |

| Royalty Rate | Profit Margin | IP Contribution |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 3%           | 5% (Low)      | 60.0%           |
| 3%           | 6.35% (Base)  | 47.2%           |
| 3%           | 8% (High)     | 37.5%           |
