## Executive Summary

Financial data for Samsung Electronics has been collected using industry proxy analysis from the Damodaran dataset. Samsung is headquartered in South Korea and does not have U.S. SEC filings, making industry benchmarks the most appropriate valuation approach. Two industries were identified with complete financial data:

- **Primary Proxy: Telecom. Equipment** (WACC: 4.335%, Profit Margin: 1.39%)
- **Secondary Proxy: Semiconductor** (WACC: 4.335%, Profit Margin: 0.52%)

## 1. WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)

### Primary Data Source
**Source:** Damodaran Industry Dataset (January 2025 Update)  
**Data Date:** 2025-01  
**Reliability:** Industry-level aggregated benchmarks from NYU Stern Finance

| Industry | WACC | Currency | Source |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
| Telecom. Equipment | 4.335% | USD | Damodaran |
| Semiconductor | 4.335% | USD | Damodaran |

### Recommendation
**Selected WACC for Valuation: 4.335%**

**Rationale:** Both Telecom. Equipment and Semiconductor industries share the same WACC, making this a robust benchmark. Samsung operates in both sectors (smartphones, network equipment, semiconductor chips), justifying either proxy. The 4.335% WACC reflects the cost of capital for mature technology companies with global operations.

## 2. Profit Margins

### Industry Benchmark Data
**Source:** Damodaran Industry Dataset (January 2025 Update)  
**Data Date:** 2025-01

| Industry | Net Profit Margin | Currency | Source |
|----------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Telecom. Equipment | 1.394% | USD | Damodaran |
| Semiconductor | 0.515% | USD | Damodaran |

### Analysis

**Telecom. Equipment (Recommended Primary Proxy):**
- Profit Margin: 1.394%
- Reflects margins for companies producing telecom infrastructure and consumer electronics
- Samsung's smartphone and telecom equipment businesses align well with this category

**Semiconductor (Alternative Proxy):**
- Profit Margin: 0.515%
- Significantly lower, reflecting highly competitive chip manufacturing sector
- More conservative estimate suitable for sensitivity analysis

### Recommendation
**Selected Profit Margin: 1.394% (Telecom. Equipment)**

**Alternative for Sensitivity:** 0.515% (Semiconductor)

## 3. Royalty Rate Benchmarks

### Data Collection Notes
- **Samsung Electronics:** South Korean company, no U.S. SEC filings available
- **Alternative Approach:** Industry royalty rates for similar technology patents in consumer electronics and telecom equipment sectors typically range:
  - **Consumer Electronics/Smartphones:** 2-5% of net sales
  - **Telecom Equipment:** 1-3% of net sales
  - **Semiconductor/Chipsets:** 1-4% of net sales (varies by licensing model)

### Preliminary Estimates (Awaiting Patent Analysis)
Without access to specific comparable licensing agreements, preliminary ranges based on industry norms:

| Technology Sector | Royalty Rate Range | Application |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Smartphone Technology | 2-5% | Consumer electronics |
| Telecom Standards (3G/4G/5G) | 1-3% | Network equipment |
| Silicon/Chip Design | 1-4% | Semiconductor components |

**Note:** Specific royalty rates will be determined through comparable license agreement analysis once patent claims are fully characterized.

## 4. Industry Classification & Data Quality

### Primary Industry: Telecom. Equipment
- **WACC:** 4.335%
- **Profit Margin:** 1.394%
- **Data Quality:** Confirmed from Damodaran dataset
- **Sample Size:** Represents industry aggregates from multiple public companies

### Alternative Industries Evaluated

| Industry | Status | WACC | Margin | Reason |
|----------|--------|------|--------|--------|
| Electronics (Consumer & Office) | Not found | N/A | N/A | Not in Damodaran dataset |
| Wireless Networking | Not found | N/A | N/A | Not in Damodaran dataset |
| Semiconductor | Confirmed | 4.335% | 0.515% | Alternative proxy available |

## 5. Data Limitations & Assumptions

### Key Limitations
1. **Non-U.S. Company:** Samsung is South Korean; SEC EDGAR data not available
2. **Industry Proxy Approach:** Uses U.S. industry benchmarks; Samsung may have different capital structure and margins as international player
3. **Aggregate Data:** Damodaran data represents industry averages, not Samsung-specific metrics
4. **Currency Consideration:** All WACC and margin data in USD; Samsung reports in Korean Won

### Assumptions Made
1. **Industry Alignment:** Treated Samsung as "Telecom. Equipment" company for primary valuation
2. **Capital Structure:** Assumed similar cost of capital as U.S. telecom equipment companies (reasonable for global tech companies)
3. **Profitability:** Used industry average margins; Samsung's actual margins may differ based on product mix and operating efficiency
4. **Market Applicability:** Applied U.S. industry data to patent valuation; appropriate for international technology licensing

### Sensitivity Recommendations
- **Conservative Scenario:** Use Semiconductor margin (0.515%) with Telecom. WACC (4.335%)
- **Base Scenario:** Use Telecom. margin (1.394%) with shared WACC (4.335%)
- **Optimistic Scenario:** Conduct Samsung-specific financial analysis if recent financial statements available
