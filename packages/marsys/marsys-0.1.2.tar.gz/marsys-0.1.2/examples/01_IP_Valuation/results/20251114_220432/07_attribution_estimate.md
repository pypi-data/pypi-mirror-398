## Attribution Methodology Selection

### Method Selection Process

**Method 1: Comparable License Royalty** - Not Available
- Rationale: No specific royalty rate data available for comparable multi-receiver wireless power transmission licenses
- Industry research revealed general Qi wireless charging programs, but specific rates for multi-receiver dynamic handshake protocols are proprietary

**Method 2: Smallest Salable Unit (SSU)** - Not Applied
- Component value data for multi-receiver wireless power systems is highly fragmented
- Market data shows overall wireless power transmission market ($17.37B in 2025), but specific receiver component values with handshake protocols are not separately disclosed
- SSU approach would require detailed BOM (Bill of Materials) analysis not available from public sources

**Method 3: Feature Value Analysis** - **SELECTED**
- Most appropriate given patent portfolio context
- Allows for systematic evaluation of patented features vs. total product features
- Based on claims analysis and technology assessment
