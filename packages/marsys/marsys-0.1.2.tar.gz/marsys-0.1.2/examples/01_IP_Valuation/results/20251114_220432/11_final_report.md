- Industry-average metrics used instead of company-specific data
- Profit margins may vary significantly by product line
- Actual licensing rates proprietary; comparable data unavailable

**Attribution Uncertainty:**
- IP contribution factor (32.61%) based on feature analysis, not empirical transaction data
- Portfolio effects (6-patent family) not fully quantified in individual patent valuation
- Cross-licensing arrangements unknown; may affect standalone value

### 14.2 Methodological Limitations

**DCF Model Constraints:**
- 10-year projection period; patent has 16 years remaining (no terminal value modeled)
- Constant profit margin assumption (1.15%); may improve or deteriorate
- Constant IP contribution assumption; may erode with competitive alternatives
- Linear growth assumptions; actual adoption may be non-linear

**Scenario Analysis:**
- Three scenarios (Low/Base/High) may not capture full probability distribution
- Monte Carlo simulation not performed; uncertainty range may be wider
- Correlation effects between variables not modeled
- Black swan events (technology disruption, regulatory changes) not quantified

**Competitive Dynamics:**
- Market share assumptions (13.6% SOM) based on current position; may not hold
