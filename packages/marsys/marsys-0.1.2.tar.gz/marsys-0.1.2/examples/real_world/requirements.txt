# Requirements for real-world multi-agent examples

# Core dependencies (from main project)
# These should already be installed if you have the MARS framework set up

# Additional dependencies for examples

# The examples assume you have the MARS framework installed
# If running standalone, ensure you have:
# - The MARS framework source code
# - All dependencies from the main requirements.txt

# API providers (install as needed based on which examples you run)
# openai>=1.0.0  # For GPT-4 examples
# anthropic>=0.3.0  # For Claude examples
# google-generativeai>=0.3.0  # For Gemini examples

# Note: xAI (Grok) uses standard HTTP requests, no special SDK needed
