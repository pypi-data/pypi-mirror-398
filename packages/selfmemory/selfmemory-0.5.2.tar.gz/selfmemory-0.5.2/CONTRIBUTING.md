# Contributing to SelfMemory

We welcome contributions to SelfMemory! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/selfmemory/selfmemory.git
   cd selfmemory
   ```
3. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install UV (if not already installed)
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Install with all development dependencies
   make install-dev
   # Or manually: uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

   # Install pre-commit hooks
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- **Python Version**: Python 3.10+
- **Package Manager**: UV (faster, more reliable than pip)
- **Code Style**: We use `ruff` for linting and formatting
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all public APIs
- **Documentation**: Docstrings required for all public functions and classes

### Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Format code
make format
# Or: uv run ruff format .

# Lint code
make lint
# Or: uv run ruff check .

# Fix auto-fixable issues
make lint-fix
# Or: uv run ruff check --fix .

# Run all quality checks
make quality

# Run pre-commit hooks manually
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing

We maintain comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test
# Or: uv run pytest

# Run with coverage report
make coverage
# Or: uv run pytest --cov=selfmemory --cov-report=html

# Run specific test markers
uv run pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
uv run pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only
```

**Test Requirements:**
- All new features must include tests
- Maintain good test coverage
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Development Process

1. **Write tests first** (TDD approach recommended)
2. **Implement feature** following existing patterns
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Run tests** to ensure nothing breaks
5. **Format and lint** code

### 3. Commit Guidelines

We use **Conventional Commits** to enable automated versioning and changelog generation. Please read our comprehensive [Commit Guidelines](COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md) for detailed information.

**Quick Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description> | #<issue> | [@username]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Feature with issue tracking
git commit -m "feat(search): add semantic search support | #62 | [@shrijayan]"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(storage): resolve connection timeout | #45 | [@shrijayan]"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs(api): update authentication guide | #78 | [@shrijayan]"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(api)!: redesign search API | #89 | [@shrijayan]"
```

**Commit Types & Version Bumps:**

| Type | Description | Version Bump |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `feat` | New feature | MINOR (0.3.0 → 0.4.0) |
| `fix` | Bug fix | PATCH (0.3.0 → 0.3.1) |
| `perf` | Performance | PATCH (0.3.0 → 0.3.1) |
| `feat!` | Breaking change | MAJOR (0.3.0 → 1.0.0) |
| `docs` | Documentation | No release |
| `test` | Tests | No release |
| `chore` | Maintenance | No release |

**Important Notes:**
- Every push to `master` with `feat:` or `fix:` commits triggers an **automated release**
- Version is automatically determined from commit messages
- CHANGELOG.md is automatically updated
- Package is automatically published to PyPI

📖 **For detailed guidelines, examples, and best practices, see [COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md](COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md)**
