"""Structured exception classes for SelfMemory based on mem0's error handling system.

This module provides comprehensive exception classes that replace generic errors
with specific, actionable exceptions. Each exception includes error codes,
user-friendly suggestions, and debug information to enable better error handling
and recovery in SelfMemory applications.
