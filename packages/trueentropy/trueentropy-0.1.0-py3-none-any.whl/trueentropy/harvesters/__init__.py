# TrueEntropy - Harvesters Package
# =============================================================================
#
# Harvesters are the entropy collectors - they gather randomness from various
# real-world sources and feed it into the entropy pool.
#
# Available Harvesters:
# - TimingHarvester: CPU jitter and scheduling randomness
# - NetworkHarvester: Network latency measurements
# - SystemHarvester: System state (RAM, processes, etc.)
# - ExternalHarvester: External APIs (earthquakes, crypto prices)
# - WeatherHarvester: Weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure)
# - RadioactiveHarvester: random.org / ANU QRNG (quantum randomness)

"""
Entropy harvesters - collectors of real-world randomness.

This package contains various harvester classes that collect entropy
from different sources and feed it into the entropy pool.
