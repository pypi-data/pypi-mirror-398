"""
BayesPrism integration for iobrpy.

This subpackage wraps the (Python) BayesPrism implementation and exposes:

- Core classes:
    * Prism
    * BayesPrism

- Result extraction helpers:
    * get_fraction
    * get_exp

- Tutorial-style pipeline:
    * run_bayesprism  (uses the bundled BP_data reference)

- CLI entry point:
    * cli_main        (called from the top-level `iobrpy` CLI)
