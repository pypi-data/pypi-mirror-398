# 📊 CSV Citation Counter

This Python script processes one or more CSV files to summarize publication and citation data by a chosen column — such as journal names, author names, or institutions.

It supports:

- ✅ Counting how many times each entry appears (e.g., number of articles per journal)
- ✅ Summing citations per entry using a `"Cited by"` column
- ✅ Calculating average and max citations per entry
- ✅ Sorting results by:
  - Number of articles [articles]
  - Total citations [total]
  - Average citations per article [avg]
- ✅ Handling multi-entry fields (e.g., multiple authors separated by `; `)
- ✅ Writing clean summaries to a human-readable `summary.txt`

##### Enter file paths or folders:
Input one path per line (CSV file or folder)

Hit Enter on an empty line when you're done

All .csv files in a folder will be included

##### Column name to analyze (e.g., Journal, Authors)
Delimiter (optional) if each csv entry has multiple elements (such as authors):

Leave blank for single-entry fields

Make sure to add a space (like "; ") if necessary.

##### Sort method (optional):
articles → by number of articles (default)

total → by total citations

avg → by average citations per article

### Output
The summary is recorded to a summary.txt in the same directory where this script was run. Blank lines separated groups with differnet values for the sort attribute.
