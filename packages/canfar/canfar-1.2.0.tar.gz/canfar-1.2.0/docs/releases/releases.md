## 🎯 CANFAR Releases

The CADC team releases the CANFAR Science Platform (CanfarSP) on a fixed, predictable schedule so users and deployers can plan upgrades.

### Who is this page for?

If you use the CANFAR Python Client or CLI:

- Use the release notes in this section to see user-visible changes in the client, CLI, and documentation.
- Each release page focuses on what changed and how it might affect your workflows.

If you deploy the Canfar Science Platform:

- Use these release notes to understand user-facing changes that may drive support or rollout timing.
- Track backend deployment changes in the [opencadc/deployments](https://github.com/opencadc/deployments) repository.

### Release Naming

CanfarSP releases are named using the year and number, in the form `CanfarSP YYYY.MM`. For example, the first release of 2025 was named **CanfarSP 2025.1**.

We currently aim for a CanfarSP release every 3 months.

In the subpages of this section of documentation, detailed notes about each release can be found.

CanfarSP releases include dedicated integration and regression testing, plus internal user testing. Generally:

- New features can only be added to CanfarSP in a fixed cycle release
- Bug fixes are added to CanfarSP immediately and result in a patch release
- Collaborators can get access to new features prior to their target release, but only as experimental software because the features have not been thoroughly tested.

### Roadmap

Currently, the CanfarSP Roadmap is managed internally by CADC, though we plan on making it public in the near future. For questions or suggestions about the CanfarSP Roadmap, please reach out to the CADC team.
