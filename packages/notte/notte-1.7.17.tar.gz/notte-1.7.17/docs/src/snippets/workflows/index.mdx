Given a script you want to set up as a workflow:

```python my_scraping_workflow.py
from notte_sdk import NotteClient, actions
notte = NotteClient()

def run(url: str):
    with notte.Session() as session:
        session.execute(type="goto", url=url)
        return session.scrape()
```

You can create, update and run workflows:

```python play_with_workflow.py
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

notte = NotteClient()

# Create a new workflow from our local Python file
workflow = notte.Workflow(
    workflow_path="my_scraping_workflow.py",
    name="My Scraping Workflow",
    description="A workflow for scraping the web"
)
print(f"Workflow created with ID: {workflow.response.workflow_id}. You can reference it using `notte.Workflow(<workflow_id>)`")

# Run the workflow, providing variables
response = workflow.run(url="https://shop.notte.cc/")
print(f"Workflow completed with result: {response.result}")

# Update workflow with new version, from our local python file
workflow.update(workflow_path="my_scraping_workflow.py")

# List all workflows
workflows = notte.workflows.list()
```
