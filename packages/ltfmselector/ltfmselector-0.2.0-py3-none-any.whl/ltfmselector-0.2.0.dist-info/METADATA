# LTFMSelector
Locally-Tailored Feature and Model Selector with Deep Q-Learning

## Installation
```
pip install ltfmselector
```

## Basic usage
```python
from ltfmselector import LTFMSelector

# Initialize an agent to learn to selects features and models, specifically tailored to each example
AgentSelector = LTFMSelector(<#episodes>, pType=<'classification', 'regression'>)

# Fit
AgentSelector(<X: pd.DataFrame>, <y: pd.Series>)

# Predict
y_pred, doc = AgentSelector.predict(<X_test: pd.DataFrame>)
```
