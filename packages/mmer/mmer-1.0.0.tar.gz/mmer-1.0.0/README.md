**MMER** is a Python package for multivariate mixed-effects regression. It uniquely features a modular fixed-effect component, supporting both parametric models and non-parametric machine learning regressors (e.g., neural networks, random forests, XGBoost). MMER handles multiple responses, grouping factors, and linear random effects structures [[1]](#references).
