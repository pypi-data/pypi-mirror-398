Experimental plot.ly plugin for glue
------------------------------------

This package is a plugin for `glue <https://glueviz.org/>`_ that allows linking glue
to `Plotly <https://plotly.com/>`_. This includes two main pieces of functionality:

- Export glue views to standalone HTML pages
- Experimental glue viewers powered by Plotly


============
Installation
============

glue-plotly can be installed using pip::

    pip install glue-plotly

Additionally, glue-plotly is included in the glue `standalone applications <https://glueviz.org/install.html>`_
for MacOS and Windows.


==============
HTML Exporters
==============

The HTML exporters are exposed as viewer tools in both `glue-qt <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-qt>`_
and `glue-jupyter <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-jupyter>`_

For glue-qt, all of the built-in matplotlib viewers are supported, along with the dendrogram viewer
and the 3D scatter viewer from the `glue-vispy-viewers <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-vispy-viewers>`_ plugin.
For glue-jupyter, the bqplot scatter, image, profile, and histogram viewers are supported. In glue-qt,
these tools are subtools of the "save" meta-tool and can be accessed from its dropdown menu.

In glue-jupyter, the Plotly exporter tools are top-level toolbar tools (look for the Plotly logo!)

========
Viewers
========

This package contains two experimental Plotly-powered viewers which can be used with glue-jupyter - a
scatter viewer and a histogram viewer. More viewers to come in the future!

`This notebook <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-plotly/blob/main/docs/PlotlyViewerExample.ipynb>`_ demonstrates
basic usage of the these viewers, such as importing and viewer creation.


=================
Package Structure
=================

- ``common`` contains methods for creating Plotly `graph objects <https://plotly.com/python/graph-objects/>`_ traces to represent glue layers and viewers that are shared between the exporters and Plotly viewers.
- ``html_exporters`` contains the implementations of the HTML exporter tools for glue-qt and glue-jupyter
- ``web`` contains the implementation of the Chart Studio exporter for Qt glue
- ``viewers`` contains the implementations of the Plotly viewers
