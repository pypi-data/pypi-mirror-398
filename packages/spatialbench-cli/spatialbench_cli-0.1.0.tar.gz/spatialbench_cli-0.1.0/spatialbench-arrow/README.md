# Spatial Bench Data Generator in Arrow format

This crate generates Spatial Bench data directly into [Apache Arrow] format using the [arrow] crate

[Apache Arrow]: https://arrow.apache.org/
[arrow]: https://crates.io/crates/arrow

# Example usage: 

See [docs.rs page](https://docs.rs/tpchgen-arrow/latest/tpchgen_arrow/)

# Testing:
This crate ensures correct results using two methods.

1. Basic functional tests are in Rust doc tests in the source code (`cargo test --doc`)
2. The `reparse` integration test ensures that the Arrow generators 
   produce the same results as parsing the original `tbl` format (`cargo test --test reparse`)
