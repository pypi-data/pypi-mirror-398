If Coord2Region isn't behaving as expected, please follow these steps before opening a new ticket:

   * :doc:`documentation/cli_tools` – Syntax reference for command-line arguments.
   * :doc:`api_reference` – Details on Python classes and parameters.

2. **Search Existing Issues**
   Someone else may have already solved your problem. Search open and closed threads on our `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/babasanfour/Coord2Region/issues>`_.
