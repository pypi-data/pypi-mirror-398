The `causalchamber` package provides different functionality for the [Causal Chambers](https://causalchamber.ai):

- **Remote API**: a Python interface to remotely access our pool of chambers and run your own experiments.
- **Datasets**: download existing datasets from the [dataset repository](https://github.com/juangamella/causal-chamber) directly into your Python code.
- **Simulators**: run simulators and mechanistic models of different chamber phenomena.
- **Ground truth**: load the ground-truth causal graphs and other information for each chamber.


Please see the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/juangamella/causal-chamber-package) for the complete documentation of the package.
