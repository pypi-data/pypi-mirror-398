GROMACS topology files for python

## Description
The `gmxtop` project provides a python interface to
* read and write toplogy and force field information from GROMACS-type top-files
* alter force field parameters 

The `gmxtop` project derives this functionality from the [kimmdy](https://github.com/graeter-group/kimmdy) project, originally developed by the graeter-group, and includes only minor modifications to parts of the original code to operate independently.
The `kimmdy` project is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) and, as a derivative work, the `gmxtop` project is distributed under the same license. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for details.
