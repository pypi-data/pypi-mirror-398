"""
hCaptcha Challenger Tools
=========================

This module provides AI-powered tools for solving various hCaptcha challenge types.

Available Tools:
    - ImageClassifier: 9-grid image selection challenges
    - ChallengeRouter: Challenge type classification with prompt extraction
    - ChallengeClassifier: Alias for ChallengeRouter (backward compatibility)
    - SpatialPathReasoner: Drag-and-drop path challenges
    - SpatialPointReasoner: Point/area selection challenges
    - SpatialBboxReasoner: Bounding box challenges

Note:
    The `_internal` module contains implementation details and should not
    be imported directly by external code.
