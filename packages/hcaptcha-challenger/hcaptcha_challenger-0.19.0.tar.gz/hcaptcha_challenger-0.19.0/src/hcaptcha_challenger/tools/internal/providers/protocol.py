"""
ChatProvider Protocol - Abstract interface for LLM providers.

This module defines the Protocol that all chat providers must implement.
Using Protocol instead of ABC allows for duck typing - external implementations
don't need to inherit from our classes.

Future implementations:
- GeminiProvider (current)
- OpenAIProvider (planned)
- AnthropicProvider (planned)
