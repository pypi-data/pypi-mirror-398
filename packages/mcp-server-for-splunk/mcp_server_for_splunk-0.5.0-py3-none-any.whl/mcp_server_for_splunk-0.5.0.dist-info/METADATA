<a name="quick-start"></a>

## 🚀 Quick Start

<a name="prerequisites"></a>

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ and UV package manager
- Nodejs (optional used for mcp inspector)
- Docker (optional but recommended for full stack)
- Splunk instance with API access (or use included Docker Splunk)

> **📖 Complete Setup Guide**: [Installation Guide](docs/getting-started/installation.md)

<a name="configuration"></a>

### Configuration

**Before running the setup, configure your Splunk connection:**

```bash
# Copy the example configuration
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env with your Splunk credentials
# - Use your existing Splunk instance (local, cloud, or Splunk Cloud)
# - OR use the included Docker Splunk (requires Docker)

# Optional HTTP transport defaults (local runs)
# - Stateless HTTP avoids sticky-session requirements
# - JSON responses improve compatibility with some clients
# These are already the defaults for local runs via `mcp-server --local`
echo "MCP_STATELESS_HTTP=true" >> .env
echo "MCP_JSON_RESPONSE=true" >> .env
```

<a name="one-command-setup"></a>

### One-Command Setup

**Windows:**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/deslicer/mcp-for-splunk.git
cd mcp-for-splunk

```python
# Start the MCP Server (project script)
uv run mcp-server --local --detached

# Verify the server
uv run mcp-server --test
# Optional: show detailed tools/resources and health output
uv run mcp-server --test --detailed
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deslicer/mcp-for-splunk.git
cd mcp-for-splunk

# (Recommended) Preview what would be installed
./scripts/smart-install.sh --dry-run

# Install missing prerequisites (base: Python, uv, Git, Node)
./scripts/smart-install.sh

# Start the MCP Server (project script)
# Local runs default to HTTP stateless mode + JSON response
uv run mcp-server --local --detached

# Verify the server
uv run mcp-server --test
# Optional: show detailed tools/resources and health output
uv run mcp-server --test --detailed
```

> **💡 Deployment Options**: The `mcp-server` command will prompt you to choose:
>
> - **Docker** (Option 1): Full stack with Splunk, Traefik, MCP Inspector - recommended if Docker is installed
> - **Local** (Option 2): Lightweight FastMCP server only - for users without Docker

> Stopping services:
> - `uv run mcp-server --stop` stops only this project's compose services (dev/prod/splunk). It does not stop the Docker engine.

> Note on Splunk licensing: When using the `so1` Splunk container, you must supply your own Splunk Enterprise license if required. The compose files include a commented example mount:
> `# - ./lic/splunk.lic:/tmp/license/splunk.lic:ro`. Create a `lic/` directory and mount your license file, or add the license via the Splunk Web UI after startup.

## 🎯 What You Can Do

<a name="ai-powered-troubleshooting-new"></a>

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Troubleshooting** (NEW!)

Transform your Splunk troubleshooting from manual procedures to intelligent, automated workflows using the MCP server endpoints:

```python
# Discover and execute intelligent troubleshooting workflows
result = await list_workflows.execute(ctx, format_type="summary")
# Returns: missing_data_troubleshooting, performance_analysis, custom_workflows...

# Run AI-powered troubleshooting with a single command
result = await workflow_runner.execute(
    ctx=ctx,
    workflow_id="missing_data_troubleshooting",
    earliest_time="-24h",
    latest_time="now",
    focus_index="main"
)
# → Parallel execution, expert analysis, actionable recommendations
```

**🚀 Key Benefits:**

- **🧠 Natural Language Interface**: "Troubleshoot missing data" → automated workflow execution
- **⚡ Parallel Processing**: Multiple diagnostic tasks run simultaneously for faster resolution
- **🔧 Custom Workflows**: Build organization-specific troubleshooting procedures
- **📊 Intelligent Analysis**: AI agents follow proven Splunk best practices

**[📖 Read the Complete AI Workflows Guide →](docs/guides/workflows/README.md)** for detailed examples, workflow creation, and advanced troubleshooting techniques.

<a name="client-integration-examples"></a>

## 🌐 Client Integration Examples

**💪 Multi-Client Configuration Strength**: One of the key advantages of this MCP Server for Splunk is its ability to support multiple client configurations simultaneously. You can run a single server instance and connect multiple clients with different Splunk environments, credentials, and configurations - all without restarting the server or managing separate processes.

<a name="multi-client-benefits"></a>

### 🔄 Multi-Client Benefits

**Session-Based Isolation**: Each client connection maintains its own Splunk session with independent authentication, preventing credential conflicts between different users or environments.

**Dynamic Configuration**: Switch between Splunk instances (on-premises, cloud, development, production) by simply changing headers - no server restart required.

**Scalable Architecture**: A single server can handle multiple concurrent clients, each with their own Splunk context, making it ideal for team environments, CI/CD pipelines, and multi-tenant deployments.

**Resource Efficiency**: Eliminates the need to run separate MCP server instances for each Splunk environment, reducing resource consumption and management overhead.

<a name="deployment-options"></a>

## 🚀 Deployment Options

<a name="development-local"></a>

### Development (Local)

- **Startup Time**: ~10 seconds
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal (single Python process)
- **Best For**: Development, testing, stdio-based AI clients
- **HTTP Defaults**: Local runs enable `MCP_STATELESS_HTTP=true` and `MCP_JSON_RESPONSE=true` by default for compatibility with Official MCP clients (no sticky sessions; JSON over SSE).
  - Endpoint: `http://localhost:8003/mcp/`
  - Required client headers:
    - `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`
    - `MCP-Session-ID: <uuid>` (preferred; `X-Session-ID` optional)
    - `X-Splunk-*` headers (host, port, username, password, scheme, verify-ssl) or set via `.env`

<a name="production-docker"></a>

### Production (Docker)

- **Features**: Load balancing, health checks, monitoring
- **Includes**: Traefik, MCP Inspector, optional Splunk
- **Best For**: Multi-client access, web-based AI agents
