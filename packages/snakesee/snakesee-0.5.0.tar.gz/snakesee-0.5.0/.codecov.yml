# Files to ignore in coverage reports
ignore:
  # Type definitions only - no runtime logic to test
  - "snakesee/types.py"
  # Logging setup code - minimal testable logic
  - "snakesee/logging.py"
  # TUI code - has unit tests but excluded because Textual framework mocking
  # creates unreliable coverage metrics; tested via tests/test_tui.py
  - "snakesee/tui/**"
