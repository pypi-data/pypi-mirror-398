# Convolog

A lightweight, color-coded logger designed specifically for **AI Swarms** and **LLM interactions**. 

When debugging multi-agent systems, it is hard to tell who is speaking. `convolog` fixes this with distinct colors for Users, Bots, Tools, and System messages.

## Installation

```bash
pip install convolog
