## Data Container

A `Container` is a lightweight directory manager with a persistent **key → file path registry**:

- Create files easily: `f = ct / "path/to/file.ext"`
- Each file is automatically registered under a logical key (default: the file name without extension)
- The registry is saved as `infos.json`
- Access registered files as attributes: `ct.output`, `ct.data`, etc.

```python
import gdutils as gd
import numpy as np

with gd.Container("out", clean=True) as ct:
    f = ct / "results/output.npy"
    np.save(f, np.arange(10))

print(ct.output)      # out/results/output.npy
```
