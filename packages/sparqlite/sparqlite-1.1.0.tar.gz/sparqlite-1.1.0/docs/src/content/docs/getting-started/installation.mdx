description: How to install sparqlite in your Python project
---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- libcurl development headers (for pycurl)

## Install with pip

```bash
pip install sparqlite
```

## System dependencies

sparqlite uses [pycurl](https://pycurl.io/) for HTTP requests, which requires libcurl development headers.

### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

### Fedora/RHEL

```bash
sudo dnf install libcurl-devel
```

### macOS

```bash
brew install curl
```

### Windows

On Windows, pycurl wheels include the necessary libraries, so no additional installation is required.

## Verify installation

```python
from sparqlite import SPARQLClient

with SPARQLClient("https://opencitations.net/meta/sparql") as client:
    print("sparqlite is ready!")
```
