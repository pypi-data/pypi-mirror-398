"""Dependency injection scopes.

This module defines the lifecycle scopes available for components in the
dependency injection container.
"""

from enum import Enum


class Scope(str, Enum):
    """Component lifecycle scope.

    Defines how instances of a component are created and cached:

    - SINGLETON: One shared instance for the lifetime of the container.
      The factory is called once and the result is cached. Subsequent
      resolve() calls return the same instance.

    - FACTORY: New instance created on each resolve() call. The factory
      is invoked every time the component is requested, creating a fresh
      instance.

    Example:
        >>> from dioxide import Container, component, Scope
        >>>
        >>> @component  # Default: SINGLETON scope
        ... class Database:
        ...     pass
        >>>
        >>> @component(scope=Scope.FACTORY)
        ... class RequestHandler:
        ...     request_id: int = 0
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self):
        ...         RequestHandler.request_id += 1
        ...         self.id = RequestHandler.request_id
        >>>
        >>> container = Container()
        >>> container.scan()
        >>>
        >>> # Singleton: same instance every time
        >>> db1 = container.resolve(Database)
        >>> db2 = container.resolve(Database)
        >>> assert db1 is db2
        >>>
        >>> # Factory: new instance every time
        >>> handler1 = container.resolve(RequestHandler)
        >>> handler2 = container.resolve(RequestHandler)
        >>> assert handler1 is not handler2
        >>> assert handler1.id != handler2.id

    Use for:
    - Request handlers
    - Transient data objects
    - Stateful components that shouldn't be shared

    """New instance created per request scope.

    Similar to FACTORY but intended for request-scoped contexts like
    web frameworks where the same instance should be reused within a
    single request but fresh instances created for each new request.

    Use for:
    - Request-scoped services in web frameworks
    - Per-request database sessions
    - Request context objects
    - User authentication/authorization state per request

    Note: Request scope behavior requires integration with a request
    context provider (e.g., FastAPI dependencies, Flask request context).
    Without such integration, REQUEST scope behaves like FACTORY.
