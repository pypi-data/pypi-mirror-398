Hi there! I'm @David (pixelglide), and in this guide, you'll learn how to use Onshape, a browser-based CAD tool, by making a christmas themed 3D printable keyring, that we'll print out and send to you!

## Guide

Since CAD guides tend to be quite screenshot heavy, you can access the guide [here](https://www.figma.com/deck/VCTut2hxPoABdrWPJl8Rdy/Haxmas-Day-3?node-id=47-692&viewport=-148%2C-1109%2C0.72&t=WeNktbno24n6tuN4-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1). 



## Note

- Artwork and graphics must be unique. That means no AI-generated artwork or stealing things by other artists
  
  

- The guide might look quite familar, and that's because it's adapted from Fusering. Please do not submit your keyring to Fusering too *(sometimes called double-dipping)*, as you will get your submission rejected by both Haxmas and Fusering.



- Designs must be christmas/winter themed!



## Submitting your project

You can submit your project [here](https://forms.hackclub.com/haxmas-day-3). Make sure you have your .step file, and a screenshot of your keyring handy for the form!



Good Luck! We look forward to reviewing all of your creations soon!
