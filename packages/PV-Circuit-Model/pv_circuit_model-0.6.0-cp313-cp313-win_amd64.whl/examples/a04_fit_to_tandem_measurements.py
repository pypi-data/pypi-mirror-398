# # Tandem Cell Measurement Fitting Demo

# This example fits a tandem cell model to the tandem measurements of a large area
# perovskite-silicon solar cell.  Each measurement is stored in a json file 
# (see json_directory) in the format that PV_Circuit_Model Measurement class can read in.
# There are three kinds of measurements:
# Light I-V at different top, bottom cell JLs (i.e. spectrometric IV)
# "Dark I-V" where one subcell is in the "dark" and the other cell is illuminated
# Suns-Voc, namely with blue, red (IR) and white light spectra
