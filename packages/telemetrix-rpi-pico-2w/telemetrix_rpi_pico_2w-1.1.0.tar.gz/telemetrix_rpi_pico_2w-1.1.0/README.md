# Telemetrix For The Raspberry Pi Pico 2W


This Python package allows you to monitor and control a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W 
board by 
simply writing a Python script using one of the telemetrix-rpi-pico-2w APIs.
APIs are provided for both synchronous and asyncio implementations for both
WiFi and USB/Serial transports.

Please refer to the [User's Guide](https://mryslab.github.io/telemetrix-rpi-pico-2w/) for 
further information, including installation 
instructions and client APIs.
