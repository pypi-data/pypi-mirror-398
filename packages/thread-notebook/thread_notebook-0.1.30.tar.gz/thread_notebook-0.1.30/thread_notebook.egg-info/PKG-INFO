# Development instructions

To run the repo in development mode, you need to run two terminal commands. One will run Jupyter Server, the other will run the NextJS front end.

To begin, run:

```
yarn install
```

Then in one terminal, run:

```
sh ./run_dev.sh
```

And in another, run:

```
yarn dev
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000/thread` and you should see your local version of Thread running.

If you would like to develop with the AI features, navigate to the `proxy` folder and run:

```
yarn install
```

Then:

```
yarn dev --port 5001
```
