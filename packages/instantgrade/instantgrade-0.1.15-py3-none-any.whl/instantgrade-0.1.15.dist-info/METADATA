## Introduction
InstantGrade is a comprehensive, extensible evaluation framework designed to automatically grade student submissions against instructor solution files. It supports multiple file formats including Python Jupyter notebooks and Excel files, making it ideal for educational institutions and online learning platforms.

The framework was created to streamline the grading process for programming and data analysis assignments, reducing manual effort while providing detailed, actionable feedback to students. The vision is to expand support to additional file types and programming languages, creating a universal evaluation platform for technical education. 


## 👩‍🏫 About the Maintainer

**Dr. Chandravesh Chaudhari**

🌐 [Website](https://chandraveshchaudhari.github.io/website/)
🔗 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandraveshchaudhari)


## Features
- **Automated Evaluation**: Compare student submissions against instructor solutions automatically
- **Multiple File Format Support**: Currently supports Python Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) and Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed HTML reports with visual feedback and scoring
- **AST Analysis**: Deep code comparison using Abstract Syntax Tree analysis for Python code
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable evaluation criteria through JSON configuration
- **Batch Processing**: Evaluate multiple student submissions in one run
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add support for new file types and evaluation strategies

#### Significance
- **Time-Saving**: Reduces manual grading effort by 90% for programming assignments
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform evaluation criteria across all student submissions
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides students with specific areas of improvement
- **Scalability**: Handles large classes with hundreds of submissions efficiently
- **Educational Focus**: Allows instructors to focus on teaching rather than repetitive grading tasks

## Installation 
This project is available at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/instantgrade/). For help in installation check 
[instructions](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-pypi)
```bash
python3 -m pip install instantgrade  
```

For development installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chandraveshchaudhari/instantgrade.git
cd evaluator
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### Docker (recommended for notebook isolation)

InstantGrade uses Docker to run student notebooks in an isolated environment. For the Docker-backed grading to work, users should install Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or Docker Engine (Linux).

- Install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- After installing Docker, make sure the daemon is running before invoking grading with `use_docker=True`.

When upgrading InstantGrade (new release), existing local Docker images named `instantgrade:latest` may be stale and could cause import or runtime errors inside the container. To avoid this, do one of the following after upgrading:

- Prefetch a new image tagged to the current commit (recommended):

```bash
# from the repository root
python tools/docker_build_image.py

# to force a rebuild even if an image exists
python tools/docker_build_image.py --force
```

- Or allow the runtime to rebuild automatically by setting the environment variable for a single run:

```bash
instantgrade_FORCE_REBUILD=1 instantgrade --solution sample_solutions.ipynb --submissions ./submissions/
```

- Developer fast-iteration option: bind-mount the `src` directory into the container so you don't need to rebuild the image on small changes.

The repository ships a small helper at `tools/docker_build_image.py` that builds a git-SHA-tagged image (and also tags `instantgrade:latest` for convenience). This is the recommended step for administrators preparing a new release in their environment.

### Dependencies
##### Required
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Data manipulation and analysis for comparison results
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/) - Reading and writing Excel files
- [nbformat](https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/) - Working with Jupyter notebook files
- [nbclient](https://nbclient.readthedocs.io/) - Executing Jupyter notebooks programmatically
- [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) - Creating command-line interfaces

##### Optional
- [xlwings](https://www.xlwings.org/) - Advanced Excel automation capabilities (Windows/macOS only)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

#### Python API
```python
from instantgrade import Evaluator

# Initialize evaluator with solution and submissions folder
evaluator = Evaluator(
    solution_file_path="path/to/solution.ipynb",
    submission_folder_path="path/to/submissions/"
)

# Run complete evaluation pipeline
report = evaluator.run()
```

#### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Evaluate Python notebook submissions
instantgrade --solution sample_solutions.ipynb --submissions ./submissions/ --output ./report/

# Evaluate Excel submissions
instantgrade --solution solution.xlsx --submissions ./excel_submissions/ --output ./excel_report/
```

## Supported File Types

### Python Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
- Executes code cells and compares outputs
- AST-based code structure comparison
- Variable and function definition verification
- Exception and error handling analysis

### Excel Files (.xlsx, .xls)
- Cell value comparison across worksheets
- Formula evaluation and verification
- Conditional formatting checks
- Chart and pivot table analysis (with xlwings)

### Future Support (Planned)
- R Markdown files (.Rmd)
- Python scripts (.py)
- SQL files (.sql)
- MATLAB scripts (.m)
