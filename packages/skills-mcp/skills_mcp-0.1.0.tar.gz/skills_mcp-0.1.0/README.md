The **Package Manager for AI Agents**.

Skills MCP connects your LLM Agent (like Claude Desktop) to a global registry of capabilities. It allows your Agent to autonomously discover, install, and learn new skills to solve complex tasks.

> **Thin MCP, Fat Agent Philosophy:** This tool handles the delivery of code and instructions, empowering the Agent to execute them using its own environment (e.g., `uv`, `bash`).

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Search:** Find skills for specific tasks (e.g., "pdf", "excel", "diagram").
- **Install:** One-click download and installation to your local machine (`~/.skills`).
- **Learn:** Provides the Agent with the exact file structure and `SKILL.md` instructions.
- **Dependency Management:** Works seamlessly with `uv` to let Agents self-manage Python environments.

---

## 📦 Installation

The recommended way to install is via `uv` (a fast Python package manager).

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `uv` (Recommended) or `pip`

```bash
# 1. Install uv (if you haven't already)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 2. Install Skills MCP globally
uv tool install skills-mcp
```

Or using pip:
```bash
pip install skills-mcp
```

## 💡 Usage Guide (for Agents)

Once installed, you can ask Claude to do things like:

1.  **Discovery:**
    > "Search for a skill that can split Excel files."
    *(Claude calls `skills_search`)*

2.  **Acquisition:**
    > "Install the excel-pro skill."
    *(Claude calls `skills_install`)*

3.  **Execution:**
    > "Read the instructions for excel-pro and split this file."
    *(Claude calls `skills_get_details`, reads the `SKILL.md`, installs dependencies via `uv`, and runs the script)*
