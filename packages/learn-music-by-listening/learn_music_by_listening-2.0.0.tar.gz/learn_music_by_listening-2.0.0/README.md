# Learn music by listening
I like listening to music. It would be good to add some random facts while I play to learn stuff.
It is easy to get AI to give you random facts - some might even be true.

## Usage
First use an AI to create a list of the form

youtube url, fact

Save this as a text file. 

Then run  lmws file.txt

This will the play the songs in order while displaying facts about the song with popups.

I like learning things while doing stuff mostly because I spend a lot of my time working or walking or doing stuff so if I learn in a drive by fashion then I will learn some stuff.  I created a subreddit on this topic called [drive by learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/driveByLearning/).

I am also intereted in learning in general though note taking and reading as @readwithai. Have a look at https://substakc.com/r/readwithai to understand this.
