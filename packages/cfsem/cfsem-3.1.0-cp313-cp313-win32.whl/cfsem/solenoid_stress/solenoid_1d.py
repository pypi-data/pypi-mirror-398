"""
Finite-difference solution to structural PDE for pancake or
infinite-length solenoid coil, following Iwasa 2e section 3.6.

Assumes
* Uniform current density within each r-section
* Zero R-Z shear (deck-of-cards structure)
* Zero Z-force,stress,strain (no axial compression accounted here; can be evaluated separately;
  usually relatively small)
* Isotropic material
    * This method could be extended to handle orthotropic material, with some effort
* Single material region
    * This method could be extended to handle multiple regions of isotropic materials

Supports
* Non-uniform r-grid
* Arbitrary current density and B-field defined on r-grid
* Nonzero pressure on inner/outer wall (fluid pressure, bucking load, etc)

    Right-hand-side for solenoid stress solve,

    From Iwasa 2e eqn. 3.64a

    Recommend padding the grid with a dummy value at either end
    to make room for the BCs without losing accounting of nonzero
    current density at the inner/outer radius.

    Padding for BCs can be done like:
    `rgrid = np.array([r0 - 1e-6] + rgrid.tolist() + [r1 + 1e-6])`

    Padding region is ultimately treated as structural material,
    so the padded region should be small to avoid introducing error,
    but not so small that it causes numerical error in the finite difference scheme.
