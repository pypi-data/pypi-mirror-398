A high-performance, buffered, non-blocking logger for Python, with the core logic implemented in Rust for maximum speed and efficiency.

This logger is designed for high-throughput applications where standard Python logging would become a bottleneck. It sends logs on a dedicated background thread, ensuring your application's main threads are never blocked by I/O.

## Features

- **Non-Blocking**: Log calls return instantly.
- **Batching**: Logs are sent to destinations in efficient batches (Elastic bulk API).
- **Resilient**: In-memory buffer with retries for when destinations are temporarily unavailable.
- **Multiple Outputs**: Configure logging to stdout, files, and Elasticsearch simultaneously.
- **Python `logging` Integration**: Includes a `logging.Handler` to seamlessly integrate with the standard library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- **`pip` version 21 or newer.**

This package uses modern Python packaging standards (PEP 517). Older versions of `pip` may not be able to install it correctly. You can upgrade `pip` with the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```
## Pre-compiled wheels for officially Supported Platforms

- **Linux**: `x86_64` (`manylinux` compatible)
- **macOS**: `arm64` (Apple Silicon, Intel)
- **Windows**: `amd64`

## Installation

```bash
pip install py-hpl-logger
```

## Quick Start

1(Optional).  **Configure your logger** with `ElasticConfig` if needed:

   ```ini
   ELASTIC_HOST=localhost
   ELASTIC_PORT=9200
   ELASTIC_USERNAME=elastic
   ELASTIC_PASSWORD=changeme
   ELASTIC_INDEX=my-python-logs
   ```

   Configure using code:

   ```python
   elastic_config = ElasticConfig(
       host="localhost",
       port=9200,
       index="my-app",
       username="elastic",
       password="changeme"
   )
   ```

   Configure using .env. You can choose `.env` search depth using `local_only` argument:

   ```python
   elastic_config = ElasticConfig.from_env(local_only=False)
   ```

2.  **Use the logger in your Python application:**

    ```python
    import logging
    from py_hpl_logger import LoggerBuilder, ElasticConfig, RustLogHandler

    # 1. Build the Rust logger backend once
    elastic_config = ElasticConfig(
        host="localhost",
        port=9200,
        index="my-app",
        username="elastic",
        password="changeme"
    )
    # default buffer params:
    # channel_size: 4096
    # batch_size: 256
    # `channel_size` sets maximum inner buffer size. If log amount exceeds this argument, over limiting logs are dropped to avoid memory leaks
    # `batch_size` is an argument used to bulk push amount of logs specified
    rust_backend = (
        LoggerBuilder()
        .with_stdout(True) # whether to use stdout or not
        .with_file_output("my_app_session")
        .with_elastic_output(elastic_config)
        .with_batch_size(1000) # how many log rows to wait before forced flush
        .with_flush_interval(1.0) # # how many seconds to wait before forced flush
        .build()
    )

    # 2. Integrate with Python's standard logging
    handler = RustLogHandler(rust_logger=rust_backend)
    formatter = logging.Formatter("%(threadName)s - %(message)s")
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(handler)

    # 3. Use the standard logging API anywhere!
    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    log.info("This log is being handled by Rust!")
    log.error("This is a high-performance error log.")

    # 4. For graceful shutdown, flush the logger before exiting
    # (The logger also attempts to flush automatically on exit)
    rust_backend.flush()
    ```

## Benchmark
Measurements completed under python3.11 on Apple M2 Max using remote Elastic Search instance with 2 Gb memory limit. The logger version used is py-hpl-logger==0.2.1.

20.000 messages were successfully written in a total time of 2.0091 seconds
```
    --- Running Benchmark for: High-Performance Rust Logger ---
    Logging 20,000 messages across 10 threads...
    Time taken for High-Performance Rust Logger: 0.1128 seconds
    Throughput: 177,282.63 logs/second

    Flushing Rust logger buffer...
    Flush took an additional 1.8963 seconds.

    --- Benchmark Results ---
    The application code was blocked for 0.1128 seconds with the Rust logger.
    Throughput: 177,282.63 logs/second
    Logs written: 20,000
    Time taken for flush: 1.8963 seconds

## Changelog

### [0.1.5] - 2025-11-04
- Added 'with_channel_size' constructor to LoggerBuilder
### [0.1.6] - 2025-11-04
- Added win_amd64 support
- Added macos_x86_64 support
- Added benchmark results
### [0.1.9] - 2025-11-06
- Added 'with_base_log' constructor to LoggerBuilder to add a base prefix '[<event.timestamp>] <event.level>:'
- Fixed potential malloc problems in stdout buffer
- Improved buffer offload with async elastic/file write execution
### [0.2.0] - 2025-11-07
- Fixed macos binaries imports
### [0.2.1] - 2025-11-08
- Added log file rotation. Now 5 files of 10Mb are set for rotation as a default setting. File rotation can be disabled with 'without_file_rotation' builder
- File rotation can be configured with 'with_file_rotation' builder. It accepts `max_file_size_bytes`: int, `max_backup_files`: int as arguments where `max_file_size_bytes` is the maximum size of each file in bytes and `max_backup_files` is the maximum number of files to keep
- Added graceful file writing at the cost of an 8% log throughput decrease
### [0.2.2] - 2025-11-10
- Fixed stdout only config not producing logs
### [0.2.3] - 2025-12-17
- Added protocol argument for `ElasticConfig`. Now Elastic can be configured to use `https` hosts. (`http` -> `https` redirects not supported for safety reasons)
```python
   elastic_config = ElasticConfig(
       host="localhost",
       port=9200,
       index="my-app",
       username="elastic",
       password="changeme"
       protocol="https", # you can skip protocol setup, default fallback is "http"
   )
```
### [0.2.4] - 2025-12-18
- Added `gzip` bulk payload compression
- Added `WARNING` and `DEBUG` levels

### [0.2.5] - 2025-12-20
- Added `atexit` hook to remove logger references on exit
You can call a cleanup yourself using Logger.close() 
```python
from py_hpl_logger import LoggerBuilder
backend = (
    LoggerBuilder()
    .with_stdout(True)
    .build()
)
backend.close()
```
