        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 2rem;">Last updated: December 21, 2025</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">1. Data Ownership & Privacy</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The data processed through Crawlio Intelligence remains your exclusive
            property. We do not store, mirror, or commercialize your extracted insights. For self-hosted instances, all
            data remains within your local infrastructure. Enterprise-tier data is processed via secure, isolated
            environments.</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">2. Responsible Usage & Compliance</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Users are responsible for ensuring that their data acquisition activities
            align with target websites' terms, robots.txt protocols, and global regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
            Crawlio Intelligence provides the tools for ethical data collection, but final implementation is the user's
            responsibility.</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">3. Data Security</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We employ advanced security protocols to safeguard your configurations and
            credentials. API keys and connection strings are encrypted and managed strictly through secure environment
            variables.</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">4. AI Processing Privacy</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Data analysis performed through our AI modules uses secure, state-of-the-art
            models. Your proprietary data is never used for training external models without explicit authorization.</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Account-level information is retained while your platform access is active.
            Data deletion requests are processed promptly. Backup cycles for managed instances follow a strict 30-day
            rotation before final erasure.</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">6. Policy Iteration</h2>
        <p>This policy may be refined to reflect evolving regulatory landscapes. Active users will be notified of
            material changes through standard communication channels.</p>
