           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# mauve-gpu

A GPU-accelerated implementation of the MAUVE score for comparing distributions, leveraging RAPIDS.ai cuML.

MAUVE is a metric for evaluating the quality of generated text by comparing the distribution of generated text to reference text in an embedding space. This library provides a fast and robust implementation using GPU acceleration for PCA and K-Means clustering.

## Features

*   **GPU Acceleration**: Uses `cupy` and `cuml` for high-performance computation.
*   **Robustness**: Implements multiple K-Means runs to select the best clustering, improving score stability.
*   **Easy Integration**: Compatible with NumPy and CuPy arrays.
*   **Configurable**: Allows tuning of PCA components, K-Means clusters, and other parameters.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python >= 3.8
*   NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
*   CUDA Toolkit (compatible with the installed RAPIDS version)

### Installing Dependencies

This library relies on RAPIDS libraries (`cuml`, `cupy`), which are best installed via Conda or from the NVIDIA PyPI index.

**Using Pip:**

You need to point pip to the NVIDIA package index to install `cuml` and `cupy`.

```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com cuml-cu12 cupy-cuda12x
pip install mauve-cuml
```

**Using Conda:**

```bash
conda create -n mauve-env -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia \
    cuml=23.10 python=3.10 cupy
conda activate mauve-env
pip install mauve-gpu
```

### Installing from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielwolber-wood/mauve-gpu.git
cd mauve-gpu
pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com -e .
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use `MauveScorer`.

```python
import numpy as np
from mauve_gpu import MauveScorer

# Generate dummy embeddings (replace with your actual embeddings)
# P: Reference distribution (e.g., human text embeddings)
# Q: Generated distribution (e.g., model text embeddings)
p_features = np.random.rand(1000, 768).astype(np.float32)
q_features = np.random.rand(1000, 768).astype(np.float32)

# Initialize the scorer
scorer = MauveScorer(
    pca_components=50,
    kmeans_clusters=100,
    num_kmeans_runs=5,
    verbose=True
)

# Compute the score
score = scorer.compute(p_features, q_features)
print(f"MAUVE Score: {score:.4f}")
```

### Parameters

*   `pca_components` (int): Number of components for PCA reduction (default: 50).
*   `kmeans_clusters` (int): Number of clusters for quantization (default: 500).
*   `num_kmeans_runs` (int): Number of K-Means runs to perform to find the best clustering (default: 10).
*   `scaling_factor` (float): The 'c' parameter in the MAUVE paper (default: 5.0).
*   `divergence_curve_points` (int): Number of points for the divergence curve (default: 100).
*   `random_state` (int): Seed for reproducibility (default: 42).
*   `verbose` (bool): If True, prints progress logs (default: False).

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for more detailed usage, including an example using `sentence-transformers` to compute MAUVE scores for text datasets.

To run the demo:

1.  Install example dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install .[examples]
    ```
2.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python examples/demo.py
    ```
