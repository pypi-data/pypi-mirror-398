# Example: Generate structures from a FASTA file
#
# This config reads sequences from a FASTA file instead of inline definitions.
# Useful for larger scale inference runs with many sequences.
#
# Copy to configs/ and customize for your setup:
#   cp examples/configs/inference_from_fasta.yaml configs/inference_fasta.yaml
#
# Usage:
#   ciffy inference configs/inference_fasta.yaml

model:
  checkpoint_path: ./checkpoints/vae/checkpoint_best.pt
  model_type: vae
  device: null

# Load sequences from FASTA file
input:
  # Path to FASTA file with sequences
  # Format: standard FASTA with headers starting with '>'
  # Headers are extracted as sequence IDs
  sequence_file: sequences.fasta

sampling:
  n_samples: 5
  temperature: 1.2  # Slightly higher for more diversity
  seed: null

output:
  output_dir: ./fasta_generated
  id_prefix: ""  # Empty prefix to use FASTA IDs directly
  save_latents: false
