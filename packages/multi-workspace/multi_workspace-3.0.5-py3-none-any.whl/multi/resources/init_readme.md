## Getting started

This repo is a [multi](https://github.com/montaguegabe/multi) workspace to manage multiple sub-repositories:

{**repo_list**}

To get started, install multi with `pipx install multi-workspace` or `uv tool install multi-workspace`.

Then install the [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=montaguegabe.multi-sync) in Cursor or VS Code. When you make new changes to the VS Code configurations or other sync config files in a sub-repo, the changes will be automatically synced to the workspace.
