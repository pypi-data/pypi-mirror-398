Info:

This directory is where all the input data (demand profiles, building information, weather data, ... ) is placed. The data is not stored on Github. It must either be generated for a specific use case or a data sample can be requested from HSLU.



For Switzerland, a complete dataset package is available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17603138). After downloading and unzipping the archive, place its contents in the "data" directory of this repository. The required directory structure is already included.



More info can be found on the documentation site (https://dem-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
