# OmniMalloc Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating the usage of the OmniMalloc.

1. `01_basic.py`: A basic example showcasing how to define allocations, create a pool, run the allocation algorithm.
2. `02_plotting.py`: Same as `basic.py` but with additional visualization of the allocation using `plot_allocation()`.
3. `03_allocators.py`: An example using different allocators from the `omnimalloc.allocators` module.
4. `04_sources.py`: An example demonstrating how to use different allocation sources for generating workloads.
5. `05_benchmark.py`: A full benchmarking script that compares different allocation strategies on various workloads,
    measuring metrics like allocation efficiency and allocation runtime, also visualizing the results.
