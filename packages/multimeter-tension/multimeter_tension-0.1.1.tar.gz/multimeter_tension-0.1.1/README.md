**Multimeter** is a Python package for quantifying and interpreting statistical tensions among multiple cosmological datasets.  
It implements the methodology introduced in the paper:

> **“Generalized tension metrics for multiple cosmological datasets”**  
> M. Leizerovich, S. Landau, C. Scóccola (2025)

The package provides a geometric framework to assess consistency across *N* datasets in a shared *D*-dimensional parameter space, going beyond standard pairwise tension measures.
