# Multimeter

**Author:** Matías Leizerovich  
Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences, University of Buenos Aires

**Multimeter** is a Python package for quantifying and interpreting statistical tensions among multiple cosmological datasets.  
It implements the methodology introduced in the paper:

> **“Generalized tension metrics for multiple cosmological datasets”**  
> M. Leizerovich, S. Landau, C. Scóccola (2025)

The package provides a geometric framework to assess consistency across *N* datasets in a shared *D*-dimensional parameter space, going beyond standard pairwise tension measures.

---

## Installation

### Install with `pip` (recommended)

```bash
pip install multimeter-tension
```
## Documentation

Full documentation (API reference, usage examples, and theory overview) is available at:

https://pypi.org/project/multimeter-tension/

---

## Usage

After installation, you can import the package as:

```python
import multimeter
```

The core tools allow for the systematic analysis of tensions among multiple datasets in a shared parameter space.  
See the documentation for worked examples and API details.
