# Imery

**Build interactive GUI applications with YAML instead of code.**

Imery lets you create [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) applications using declarative YAML files, powered by [Dear ImGui Bundle](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle) for Python.

## Why Imery?

Traditional GUI development with ImGui requires writing repetitive boilerplate code. Every button, slider, or layout change means modifying and recompiling your application.

### Origins

Imery emerged from building an audio viewing and analysis tool with imgui-bundle. We discovered that live data observation and manipulation was a central pattern - UI components constantly consuming and updating data in real-time. This led us to separate concerns in an MVC-like direction: the UI as a tree structure consuming an equivalent data tree, similar to React's approach in the web world.

While most UI elements directly manipulate or observe data tree nodes, the framework also supports event generation and handling. We're also exploring a broader vision: an "Imery browser" where you write interactive applications with Python and YAML instead of HTML and JavaScript.

These concepts are in early alpha. **We'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions.**

For architectural details, see [docs/design/main.md](docs/design/main.md).

**Imery changes this:**
- **Declarative** - Define your UI in YAML, not code
- **Rapid iteration** - Edit layouts without recompiling
- **No programming required** - Create simple UIs with just YAML
- **Modular** - Reusable widget definitions with imports
- **Data-driven** - Separate UI structure from application logic

## Quick Example

Create a simple GUI in `app.yaml`:

```yaml
app:
  window_title: "Hello Imery"
  widget: builtin.text
  data: greeting

data:
  greeting:
    metadata:
      label: "Welcome to Imery!"
```

Run it:

```bash
imery --main app
```

That's it. No Python code, no compilation - just a YAML file describing what you want.

## Who is Imery for?

- **Python developers** who prefer declarative approaches
- **ImGui users** frustrated with boilerplate code
- **Data scientists** needing quick interactive tools
- **Game developers** prototyping UI and tools
- **Anyone** who wants to experiment with ImGui without writing code

## Framework or Library?

Both. Imery provides structure and patterns (like a framework) but you can use it flexibly, picking what you need (like a library). Use it however it serves you best.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Early Alpha** - Imery is experimental. APIs will change, features are incomplete, and breaking changes should be expected. We welcome feedback and contributions!

## Installation

```bash
pip install imery
```

Requires Python 3.12+

## Examples

Check out the [demo](demo/) directory for examples:
- `demo/classic/` - Classic ImGui demo widgets
- `demo/hello-imgui/` - Basic Hello ImGui examples
- `demo/hello-imgui-full/` - Full-featured application layout

Run any demo:

```bash
imery --layouts-path demo/hello-imgui-full --main app
```

## Documentation

- [Imery Lang Reference](docs/imery-lang.md) - YAML syntax and widget reference
- [Design Overview](docs/design/main.md) - Architecture and design patterns

For more examples, explore the YAML files in the demo directories.

## How It Works

1. **Write YAML** - Define your UI structure, widgets, and data
2. **Import modules** - Compose UIs from reusable components
3. **Run** - Imery renders your YAML as a native ImGui application
4. **Iterate** - Change the YAML and see updates immediately

## Contributing

We're in early development and actively seeking feedback:
- Try Imery with your use cases
- Report issues and suggest features
- Share what works and what doesn't

Your input helps shape Imery's direction.
