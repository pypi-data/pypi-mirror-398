MIRA Constants and Configuration Values

Central location for all magic numbers, paths, and configuration constants.

Storage Architecture (Hybrid Model):
=====================================

GLOBAL (~/.mira/):
  - custodian.db     User preferences (follow you everywhere)
  - insights.db      Error patterns & decisions (useful across projects)
  - config.json      Global configuration

PROJECT (<cwd>/.mira/):
  - local_store.db   Conversation index for THIS project
  - artifacts.db     Code artifacts from THIS project
  - concepts.db      Codebase concepts ("this project uses React")
  - sync_queue.db    Sync state for this project
  - local_vectors.db Local semantic search vectors
  - server.json      Remote storage credentials (can be project-specific)
  - archives/        Conversation file copies
  - metadata/        Extracted session metadata
  - mira.log         Project-specific log

Dependencies are managed via pip (see pyproject.toml):
  - Core: pip install claude-mira3
  - Semantic search: pip install claude-mira3[semantic]
