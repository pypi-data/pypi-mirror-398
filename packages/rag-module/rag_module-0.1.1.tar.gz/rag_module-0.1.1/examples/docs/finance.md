# Finance Fundamentals

Finance is the study and management of money, investments, and financial instruments. It encompasses personal finance, corporate finance, and public finance, each dealing with how entities acquire and manage monetary resources.

## Core Concepts

### Time Value of Money

The time value of money (TVM) is a fundamental principle stating that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This concept underpins most financial decisions and calculations.

The present value formula is: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n

Where:
- PV = Present Value
- FV = Future Value
- r = Interest rate per period
- n = Number of periods

### Compound Interest

Compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principal and accumulated interest from previous periods. Albert Einstein reportedly called it the "eighth wonder of the world." The formula is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal
- r = Annual interest rate
- n = Compounding frequency
- t = Time in years

## Investment Vehicles

### Stocks

Stocks represent ownership shares in a company. Shareholders may receive dividends and benefit from capital appreciation. Stock prices are influenced by company performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment.

Key metrics for stock analysis:
- **P/E Ratio**: Price-to-earnings ratio measures valuation
- **EPS**: Earnings per share indicates profitability
- **Market Cap**: Total market value of outstanding shares
- **Dividend Yield**: Annual dividends divided by stock price

### Bonds

Bonds are fixed-income securities representing loans made by investors to borrowers. The issuer pays periodic interest (coupon) and returns the principal at maturity.

Types of bonds:
- **Government Bonds**: Treasury bills, notes, and bonds issued by governments
- **Corporate Bonds**: Issued by companies to fund operations or expansion
- **Municipal Bonds**: Issued by state and local governments, often tax-exempt

### Mutual Funds and ETFs

Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to purchase diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are similar but trade on exchanges like stocks.

Advantages include diversification, professional management, and liquidity.

## Risk Management

### Diversification

Diversification reduces risk by spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies. The principle is captured in the saying "don't put all your eggs in one basket."

Modern Portfolio Theory, developed by Harry Markowitz, provides a mathematical framework for constructing diversified portfolios that maximize expected return for a given level of risk.

### Hedging

Hedging involves taking offsetting positions to reduce exposure to specific risks. Common hedging instruments include:

- **Options**: Contracts giving the right to buy or sell at a specified price
- **Futures**: Agreements to buy or sell assets at a future date
- **Swaps**: Exchanges of cash flows or liabilities between parties

## Financial Statements

### Balance Sheet

The balance sheet shows a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. The fundamental equation is:

Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity

### Income Statement

The income statement reports revenues, expenses, and profits over a period. Key components include:
- Revenue (sales)
- Cost of goods sold (COGS)
- Gross profit
- Operating expenses
- Net income

### Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement tracks cash movements in three categories:
- **Operating activities**: Cash from core business operations
- **Investing activities**: Cash used for investments and asset purchases
- **Financing activities**: Cash from debt and equity transactions

## Personal Finance

### Budgeting

The 50/30/20 rule is a popular budgeting guideline:
- 50% for needs (housing, food, utilities)
- 30% for wants (entertainment, dining out)
- 20% for savings and debt repayment

### Retirement Planning

Common retirement accounts include:
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential matching contributions
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages
- **Roth IRA**: After-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals

The rule of thumb is to save 10-15% of income for retirement starting in your 20s.

### Emergency Fund

Financial advisors recommend maintaining 3-6 months of living expenses in an easily accessible emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses or income loss.

## Market Concepts

### Market Efficiency

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) suggests that asset prices reflect all available information. In its strong form, it implies that even insider information cannot provide an advantage.

### Bull and Bear Markets

- **Bull Market**: Extended period of rising prices (typically 20%+ gain)
- **Bear Market**: Extended period of falling prices (typically 20%+ decline)

### Inflation

Inflation is the rate at which the general price level rises, eroding purchasing power. Central banks target moderate inflation (typically 2%) as a sign of healthy economic growth.
