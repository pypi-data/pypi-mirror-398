# MuffinBite

## What MuffinBite Is (Authoritative)

MuffinBite is a **Python-based interactive CLI tool** for sending **personalized bulk emails** using predefined campaigns and **explicit, user-triggered execution**.

MuffinBite sends emails **only when a user runs a command in the CLI**.  
It does **not** run background jobs, scheduled tasks, queues, or analytics services.

If a feature or command is not explicitly documented in this file, it does not exist in the current version of MuffinBite.
