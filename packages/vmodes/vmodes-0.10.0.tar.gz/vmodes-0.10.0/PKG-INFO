VModeS is a library for vectorized decoding of Mode S and ADS-B messages
sent by an aircraft.

The library has the following features

1. Decode Mode S and ADS-B aircraft data

   - ICAO address
   - aircraft callsign
   - aircraft category
   - surface and airborne positions
   - altitude
   - position uncertainty

2. Validate surface and airborne positions according to ICAO standard.
3. Designed for real-time, streaming, and batching applications.
4. Use NumPy and Cython for the performance of the calculations.

Install library with::

    pip install vmodes

Read API documentation::

    pydoc vmodes

This library is inspired by pyModeS project by Junzi Sun. Learn more about
