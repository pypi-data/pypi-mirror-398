"""
Network Manager Module

This module provides network communication management for client-server interactions,
including message sending, receiving, and health checks.

Key Features:
    - Secure socket communication with timeout handling
    - Message serialization using pickle
    - Health check mechanism for server availability
    - Error handling and connection management

Classes:
    NetworkManager: Main class for managing network operations

Global Variables:
    None

    Methods:
        send_to_server: Send messages to server with connection handling
        receive_message: Receive complete messages from socket with timeout
        health_check: Perform health check on server with full validation
