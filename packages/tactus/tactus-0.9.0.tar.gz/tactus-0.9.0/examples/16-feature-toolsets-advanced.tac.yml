# Advanced Toolset Configuration Example
# Demonstrates config-defined toolsets with filtering, prefixing, and composition

# Define custom toolsets in config
toolsets:
  # Plugin toolset with local Python tools
  financial:
    type: plugin
    paths:
      - "./examples/tools/calculations.py"

  # Plugin toolset with all tools from examples/tools
  plugin:
    type: plugin
    paths:
      - "./examples/tools"

  # Filter the test MCP server to only include greet tool
  test_filtered:
    type: filtered
    source: test_server
    pattern: "^test_server_greet$"

  # Combined toolset merging multiple sources
  all_tools:
    type: combined
    sources:
      - financial
      - test_filtered
      - done

# Clear tool_paths to avoid auto-creating duplicate plugin toolset
tool_paths: []
