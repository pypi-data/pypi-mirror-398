License: NXAI COMMUNITY LICENSE AGREEMENT
        
        Preamble 1
        
        We are proud to present the NXAI TiRex time series model and software, demonstrating the strength of xLSTM for time series. While TiRex is freely available for open research and development, we believe that organizations significantly benefiting from our technology should contribute back. Our goal is to support research, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and open innovation, while ensuring that large enterprises who incorporate TiRex into commercial products or services fairly compensate the creators for their research and development efforts.

# tirex-mirror

Unofficial mirror of [NX-AI/tirex](https://github.com/NX-AI/tirex) for packaging.

## Legal Notice

This is an unofficial mirror of [NX-AI/tirex](https://github.com/NX-AI/tirex).
See [NOTICE.txt](NOTICE.txt) and [LICENSE_MIRROR.txt](LICENSE_MIRROR.txt) for attribution details.
The original project is licensed under the terms in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Purpose

This repository automatically mirrors the upstream TiRex project and publishes it to PyPI as `tirex-mirror` for packaging and distribution purposes.

**Installation**: `pip install tirex-mirror`  
**Import**: `import tirex`

## Development Notes

### Setting up local environment

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install build dependencies
pip install build toml twine
```

### Dry run workflow steps locally

Run commands from `publish.yml`.

Test building the package
```bash
python -m build
```

### Manual publishing

Check package contents
```bash
twine check dist/*
```

Test upload to TestPyPI (optional)
```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

Real upload to PyPI
```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

Test the package (from testpypi):
```bash
pip install \
  --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
  --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple \
  tirex-mirror==2025.06.09
```

### GitHub Releases

The workflow automatically creates GitHub releases alongside PyPI releases.

```bash
# View releases
gh release list

# Create manual release (if needed)
VERSION="2025.06.09"
gh release create "v$VERSION" \
  --title "TiRex Mirror v$VERSION" \
  --notes "Manual release" \
  dist/*

# Manual workflow trigger
gh workflow run publish.yml

# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow=publish.yml
```

### Cleanup after testing

Remove all untracked and ignored files and folders
```bash
git ls-files -o -i --exclude-standard | grep -vE '^(\.venv|venv)/' | xargs -r rm -rf
```
